Similarly, the Integrator and the OwnerOperator may be the same organization.\nWhen a transfer of physical control occurs, the supplier ships the equipment (a Device or Composite) and an electronic Ticket(see[6](/\u00A7_Ref25765793)) that describes the equipment. The receiver may use the Ticket to authenticate the origin of the equipment using the mechanisms defined in this standard or save it so it can be provided when the equipment is transferred to another actor.\nWhile an actor has physical control, the actor may Install, Provision, Configure or Operate(see[Table 2](/\u00A7_Ref17505968)) the equipment. For example, if an actor (e.g., a CompositeBuilder) makes changes to a Device and then transfers this Device to another actor (e.g., an OwnerOperator) then those changes may restrict what the new owner is able to do, i.e., CompositeBuilder may install an Application used for maintenance that the OwnerOperator cannot access.\nThe workflows (see[4.3](/\u00A7_Ref94586426)) describe this process in more detail."

      "Content": "The onboarding process defined in this document describes how an OwnerOperator can authenticate Devices added to the network. This document does not define any mechanisms to allow Devices to authenticate the network it is connected to. This implies that a Device connected to a network will allow itself to be configured via any network that it is connected to. This behaviour is called \u0022Trust on First Use\u0022 or TOFU.\nWhen first connected to a network the DCA will be in an initial state where it will either attempt to discover a network service that it can get its configuration ( PullManagement, see[7.2](/\u00A7_Ref99376121)) or wait for another application to provide its configuration ( PushManagement, see[7.3](/\u00A7_Ref99376253)).\nOnce the onboarding process completes the DCA is supplied with credentials that authorize Applications that are allowed to make changes to its security configuration. Devices should have a mechanism to return the DCA to an initial state which discards all configuration, including all credentials and TrustLists that were assigned in a previous onboarding process.\nThe new state allows the TOFU onboarding process to start again. Note the initial state is not the same as a factory reset which typically deletes all software installed on the Device. The reset mechanism should require proof of physical possession of the Device to ensure it cannot be exploited remotely.\nThe TOFU model exposes the Device to malicious actors that are running on the network. This means the network used for configuration has to be protected to make it harder for a malicious actor to gain access to the network. OwnerOperators should also have network services designed to detect and eliminate malicious applications that attempt to interfere with the onboarding process.\nDevices may have other ways to assign the credentials provided by the onboarding process in order to avoid the risks associated with TOFU."

How this information is transmitted is out of scope but it could be email, a block chain ledger, cloud based webservice, a file on a USB stick or some other mechanism. This specification defines the format of a document that contains information that needs to be provided with a Device. A Ticket is the term used for a document that describes one or more Devices and has a Digital Signature that can be used to verify that the contents of the document have not been altered and that they confirm the origin of the Device.\nTickets are long lived documents which means the signing Certificate should be issued by a widely trusted root Certificate Authority that is likely to be in business even if the Manufacturer or CompositeBuilder has gone out of business. Tickets allow additional Signatures to be added at any time by an entity in the chain of physical control. The current owner of a Device validates the Ticket by choosing a Signature created by an authority it trusts.\nFor example, a CompositeBuilder re-signs the Tickets for the Devices to associate the CompositeInstanceUri with the Device Ticket(see[8.1](/\u00A7_Ref51594798)). Customers of the CompositeBuilder will not need a relationship with the Manufacturer of the Device to validate the Ticket.\nDeviceIdentity Certificates are typically signed with a chain ending in a root CA owned by the Manufacturer or CompositeBuilder. Tickets are typically signed with a Certificate issued to the Manufacturer by a well-known root CA.

This Ticket could be stored on the Device or on physical media that was delivered with the Device. When a Device is connected to the network the Ticket is either manually uploaded to the Registrar by the technician installing the Device or is read from the Device during the authentication process. For this strategy to be secure the Certificates used to sign the Tickets are provided to the Registrar in advance by the RegistrarAdmin. A Device is authorized to be on the network if the Ticket is valid, it matches the Device and is signed by a trusted Ticket authority.\nThe steps to validate a Ticket are as follows:\nVerify that a signing Certificate is valid and trusted;\nVerify the Signature is valid;\n\nTickets that are not valid shall not be used.\nTickets may have multiple signatures added by different actors in the supply chain.

The sequence automatically repeats until the Device receives its DCA Certificate and no software update is required. Any errors occur the sequence restarts from the beginning.

      "Content": "Namespaces are used by OPC UA to create unique identifiers across different naming authorities. The Attributes NodeId and BrowseName are identifiers. A Node in the UA AddressSpace is unambiguously identified using a NodeId. Unlike NodeIds, the BrowseName cannot be used to unambiguously identify a Node. Different Nodes may have the same BrowseName. They are used to build a browse path between two Nodes or to define a standard Property.\nServers may often choose to use the same namespace for the NodeId and the BrowseName. However, if they want to provide a standard Property, its BrowseName shall have the namespace of the standards body although the namespace of the NodeId reflects something else, for example the EngineeringUnits Property. All NodeIds of Nodes not defined in this document shall not use the standard namespaces.\n[Table 37](/\u00A7_Ref16577438) provides a list of namespaces and their index used for BrowseNames in this document. The default namespace of this document is not listed since all BrowseNames without prefix use this default namespace.\nTable 37 - Namespaces used in this document"
