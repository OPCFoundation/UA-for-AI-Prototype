      "Content": "The NodeIds of all Nodes described in this standard are only symbolic names.[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) defines the actual NodeIds.\nThe symbolic name of each Node defined in this standard is its BrowseName, or, when it is part of another Node, the BrowseName of the other Node, a \u0022.\u0022, and the BrowseName of itself. In this case \u0022part of\u0022 means that the whole has a HasProperty or HasComponent Reference to its part. Since all Nodes not being part of another Node have a unique name in this standard, the symbolic name is unique. For example, the ServerType defined in[6.3.1](/\u00A7_Ref129643266) has the symbolic name \u0022ServerType\u0022. One of its InstanceDeclarations would be identified as \u0022ServerType.ServerCapabilities\u0022. Since this Object is complex, another InstanceDeclaration of the ServerType is \u0022ServerType.ServerCapabilities.MinSupportedSampleRate\u0022. The Server Object defined in[8.3.2](/\u00A7_Ref129412931) is based on the ServerType and has the symbolic name \u0022Server\u0022. Therefore, the instance based on the InstanceDeclaration described above has the symbolic name \u0022Server.ServerCapabilities.MinSupportedSampleRate\u0022.\nThe NamespaceIndex for all NodeIds defined in this standard is 0. The namespace for this NamespaceIndex is specified in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3).\nNote that this standard not only defines concrete Nodes, but also requires that some Nodes have to be generated, for example one for each Session running on the Server. The NodeIds of those Nodes are server-specific, including the Namespace. However the NamespaceIndex of those Nodes cannot be the NamespaceIndex 0, because they are not defined by the OPC Foundation but generated by the Server."

For example, most Clients will attempt to reconnect after a failure immediately and then progressively increase the delay between attempts until some maximum delay. This time can be used to trigger the Client to start its reconnect logic with some delay.\nLocalTime is a structure containing the Offset and the DaylightSavingInOffset flag. The Offset specifies the time difference (in minutes) between the Server time in UTC and the local time at the Server location. If DaylightSavingInOffset is TRUE, then Standard/Daylight savings time (DST) at the Server location is in effect and Offset includes the DST correction.

      "Content": "Clients switching between network paths to the same Server behave the same as HotAndMirrored redundancy. Server and network redundancy can be combined. In the combined approach it is important for the Client to know which ServerUris belong to the same Server representing different network paths and which ServerUris represent different Servers. Therefore, a Server implementing non-transparent network redundancy shall use the NonTransparentNetworkRedundancyType to identify its redundancy support.\nRedundancySupport is inherited from the ServerRedundancyType. It shall be set to COLD, WARM, HOT or HOT_AND_MIRRORED for all instances of the NonTransparentNetworkRedundancyType. If no Server redundancy is supported (the ServerUriArray only contains one entry), the RedundancySupport shall be set to HOT_AND_MIRRORED.\nThe ServerNetworkGroups contains an array of NetworkGroupDataType. The URIs of the Servers in that array (in the serverUri of the structure) shall be exactly the same as the ones provided in the ServerUriArray. However, the order might be different. Thus the array represents a list of HotAndMirrored redundant Servers. If a Server only supports network redundancy, it has only one entry in the ServerNetworkGroups. The networkPaths in the structure represents the redundant network paths for each of the Servers. The networkPaths describes the different paths (one entry for each path) ordered by priority. Each network path contains an endpointUrlList having an array of Strings each containing a URL of an Endpoint. This allows using different protocol options for the same network path.\nThe Endpoints provided shall match with the Endpoints provided by the GetEndpoints Service of the corresponding Server."

It may do this, for example, by putting GUIDs into the ByteString. Clients can use the EventId to assist in minimizing or eliminating gaps and overlaps that may occur during a redundancy failover. The EventId shall always be returned as value and the Server is not allowed to return a StatusCode for the EventId indicating an error.\nEventType describes the specific type of Event. The EventType shall always be returned as value and the Server is not allowed to return a StatusCode for the EventType indicating an error.\nThe SourceNode Property identifies the Node that the Event originated from. If the Event is not specific to a Node the NodeId is set to null. Some subtypes of this BaseEventType may define additional rules for the SourceNode Property.\nSourceName provides a description of the source of the Event. This could be the string-part of the DisplayName of the Event source using the default locale of the server, if the Event is specific to a Node, or some server-specific notation.\nTime provides the time the Event occurred. This value is set as close to the event generator as possible. It often comes from the underlying system or device. Once set, intermediate OPC UA Servers shall not alter the value.\nReceiveTime provides the time the OPC UA Server received the Event from the underlying device of another Server. ReceiveTime is analogous to ServerTimestamp defined in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4), i.e. in the case where the OPC UA Server gets an Event from another OPC UA Server, each Server applies its own ReceiveTime. That implies that a Client may get the same Event, having the same EventId, from different Servers"

The ReceiveTime shall always be returned as value and the Server is not allowed to return a StatusCode for the ReceiveTime indicating an error.\nLocalTime is a structure containing the Offset and the DaylightSavingInOffset flag. The Offset specifies the time difference (in minutes) between the Time Property and the time at the location in which the event was issued. If DaylightSavingInOffset is TRUE, then Standard/Daylight savings time (DST) at the originating location is in effect and Offset includes the DST correction. If FALSE then the Offset does not include DST correction and DST may or may not have been in effect.\nMessage provides a human-readable and localizable text description of the Event. The Server may return any appropriate text to describe the Event. A null string is not a valid value; if the Server does not have a description, it shall return the string part of the BrowseName of the Node associated with the Event.\nSeverity is an indication of the urgency of the Event. This is also commonly called \u0022priority\u0022. Values will range from 1 to 1 000, with 1 being the lowest severity and 1 000 being the highest. Typically, a severity of 1 would indicate an Event which is informational in nature, while a value of 1 000 would indicate an Event of catastrophic nature, which could potentially result in severe financial loss or loss of life.\nIt is expected that very few Server implementations will support 1 000 distinct severity levels. Therefore, Server developers are responsible for distributing their severity levels across the 1 to 1 000 range in such a manner that clients can assume a linear distribution. For example, a client wishing to present five severity levels to a user should be able to do the following mapping:\nClient Severity"

The Server developer will instead intelligently map the underlying source severities to the 1 to 1 000 OPC Severity range in some other fashion. In particular, it is recommended that Server developers map Events of high urgency into the OPC severity range of 667 to 1 000, Events of medium urgency into the OPC severity range of 334 to 666 and Events of low urgency into OPC severities of 1 to 333.\nFor example, if a source supports 16 severity levels that are clustered such that severities 0 to 2 are considered to be LOW, 3 to 7 are MEDIUM and 8 to 15 are HIGH, then an appropriate mapping might be as follows:\nOPC Range\nSource Severity\nOPC Severity\nHIGH (667 to 1 000)\n15\n1 000\n\n14\n955\n\n13\n910\n\n12\n865\n\n11\n820\n\n10\n775\n\n9\n730\n\n8\n685\nMEDIUM (334 to 666)\n7\n650\n\n6\n575\n\n5\n500\n\n4\n425\n\n3\n350\nLOW (1 to 333)\n2\n300\n\n1\n150\n\n0\n1\n\nSome Servers might not support any Events"

This array is of a complex DataType holding the diagnostic information about the session. Each Object representing a session references a complex Variable containing the information about the session using the same DataType as the array containing information about all sessions. Such a Variable also exposes all its information as Variables with simple DataTypes containing the same information as in the complex DataType. Not shown in[Figure 10](/\u00A7_Ref134945892) is the security-related information per session, which follows the same rules.\nThe Server provides an array with an entry per subscription containing diagnostic information about this subscription. Each entry of this array is also exposed as a complex Variable with Variables for each individual value. Each Object representing a session also provides such an array, but provides the subscriptions of that session.\nThe arrays containing information about the sessions or the subscriptions may be of different length for different connections with different user credentials since not all users may see all entries of the array. That also implies that the length of the array may change if the user is impersonated. Therefore, clients that subscribe to a specific index range may get unexpected results."

The Server is no longer functioning. The recovery procedure from this situation is vendor-specific. Most Service requests should be expected to fail.\nNO_CONFIGURATION\n2\nThe Server is running but has no configuration information loaded and therefore does not transfer data.\nSUSPENDED\n3\nThe Server has been temporarily suspended by some vendor-specific method and is not receiving or sending data.\nSHUTDOWN\n4\nThe Server initiated a shut down or is in the process of shutting down. This ServerState is intended as an indication to Clients connected to the Server to orderly disconnect from the Server before the Server completes the shut down.\nTEST\n5\nThe Server is in Test Mode. The outputs are disconnected from the real hardware, but the Server will otherwise behave normally. Inputs may be real or may be simulated depending on the vendor implementation. StatusCode will generally be returned normally.\nCOMMUNICATION_FAULT\n6\nThe Server is running properly, but is having difficulty accessing data from its data sources. This may be due to communication problems or some other problem preventing the underlying device, control system, etc. from returning valid data. It may be a complete failure, meaning that no data is available, or a partial failure, meaning that some data is still available. It is expected that items affected by the fault will individually return with a BAD FAILURE status code indication for the items.\nUNKNOWN\n7\nThis state is used only to indicate that the OPC UA Server does not know the state of underlying system."

General considerations for using the Address Space Model can be found in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3).\nThis annex is for information only, that is, each Server vendor can model its data in the appropriate way that fits its needs.\nThe following subclauses describe the design decisions made while modelling the Server Object.

The NodeIds of the containing Nodes are also well-known because their symbolic name is specified in this standard and the NodeId is based on the symbolic name in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6). Nevertheless, aggregating Servers may want to expose the Server Objects of the OPC UA Servers they are aggregating in their AddressSpace. Therefore, it is very helpful to have a type definition for the Server Object. The Server Object is an Object, because it groups a set of Variables and Objects containing information about the Server. The ServerType is a complex ObjectType, because the basic structure of the Server Object should be well-defined. However, the Server Object can be extended by adding Variables and Objects in an appropriate structure of the Server Object or its containing Objects."

It is an array of a complex data structure, providing information of a subscription. Because a Server typically has several subscriptions, it is an array. Some clients may want to read the diagnostic information about all subscriptions at once; therefore it is modelled as an array in a Variable. On the other hand, a client may be interested in only a single entry of the complex structure, such as the PublishRequestCount. Therefore, each entry of the array is also exposed individually as a complex DataVariable, having each entry exposed as simple data.\nNote that it is never necessary to expose the individual entries of an array to access them separately. The Services already allow accessing individual entries of an array of a Variable. However, if the entries should also be used for other purposes in the AddressSpace, such as having References or additional Properties or exposing their complex structure using DataVariables, it is useful to expose them individually."

But to fulfil the needs of different clients, it may be helpful.\nUsing complex DataVariables automatically leads to providing redundant information, because the information is directly provided in the complex DataType of the Value Attribute of the complex Variable, and also exposed individually in the components of the complex Variable.\nThe diagnostics information about subscriptions is provided in two different locations. One location is the SubscriptionDiagnosticsArray of the ServerDiagnostics Object, providing the information for all subscriptions of the Server. The second location is the SubscriptionDiagnosticsArray of each individual SessionDiagnosticsObject Object, providing only the subscriptions of the session. This is useful because some clients may be interested in only the subscriptions grouped by sessions, whereas other clients may want to access the diagnostics information of all sessions at once.\nThe SessionDiagnosticsArray and the SessionSecurityDiagnosticsArray of the SessionsDiagnosticsSummary Object do not expose their individual entries, although they represent an array of complex data structures. But the information of the entries can also be accessed individually as components of the SessionDiagnostics Objects provided for each session by the SessionsDiagnosticsSummary Object. A client can either access the arrays (or parts of the arrays) directly or browse to the SessionDiagnostics Objects to get the information of the individual entries. Thus, the information provided is redundant, but the Variables containing the arrays do not expose their individual entries."

The remaining shalls in this annex only remains as infrormational as an artifact of the pre-depricated version.\nThe OPC Binary XML Schema defines the format of OPC Binary TypeDictionaries. Each OPC Binary TypeDictionary is an XML document that contains one or more TypeDescriptions that describe the format of a binary-encoded value. Applications that have no advanced knowledge of a particular binary encoding can use the OPC Binary TypeDescription to interpret or construct a value.\nThe OPC Binary Type Description System does not define a standard mechanism to encode data in binary. It only provides a standard way to describe an existing binary encoding. Many binary encodings will have a mechanism to describe types that could be encoded; however, these descriptions are useful only to applications that have knowledge of the type description system used with each binary encoding. The OPC Binary Type Description System is a generic syntax that can be used by any application to interpret any binary encoding.\nThe OPC Binary Type Description System was originally defined in the OPC Complex Data Specification. The OPC Binary Type Description System described in Annex C is quite different and is correctly described as the OPC Binary Type Description System Version 2.0.\nEach TypeDescription is identified by a TypeName which shall be unique within the TypeDictionary that defines it. Each TypeDictionary also has a TargetNamespace which should be unique among all OPC Binary TypeDictionaries. This means that the TypeName qualified with the TargetNamespace for the dictionary should be a globally-unique identifier for a TypeDescription.\n[Figure C.1](/\u00A7_Ref246082533) illustrates the structure of an OPC Binary TypeDictionary."

      "Content": "Figure C. 1 - OPC Binary Dictionary structure\nEach binary encoding is built from a set of opaque building blocks that are either primitive types with a fixed length or variable-length types with a structure that is too complex to describe properly in an XML document. These building blocks are described with an OpaqueType. An instance of one of these building blocks is a binary-encoded value.\nThe OPC Binary Type Description System defines a set of standard OpaqueTypes that all OPC Binary TypeDictionaries should use to build their TypeDescriptions. These standard type descriptions are described in Clause[C.3](/\u00A7_Ref136568173).\nIn some cases, the binary encoding described by an OpaqueType may have a fixed size which would allow an application to skip an encoded value that it does not understand. If that is the case, then the LengthInBits attribute should be specified for the OpaqueType. If authors of TypeDictionaries need to define new OpaqueTypes that do not have a fixed size then they should use the documentation elements to describe how to encode binary values for the type. This description should provide enough detail to allow a human to write a program that can interpret instances of the type.\nA StructuredType breaks a complex value into a sequence of values that are described by a FieldType. Each FieldType has a name, type and a number of qualifiers that specify when the field is used and how many instances of the type exist. A FieldType is described completely in[C.2.6](/\u00A7_Ref193629580).\nAn EnumeratedType describes a numeric value that has a limited set of possible values, each of which has a descriptive name. EnumeratedTypes provide a convenient way to capture semantic information associated with what would otherwise be an opaque numeric value."
