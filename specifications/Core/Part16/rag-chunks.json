It defines ObjectTypes, VariableTypes and ReferenceTypes and explains how they should be used.\nThis document is an integral part of this standard, that is, the types defined in this document shall be used as defined. However, it is not required but strongly recommended that a Server uses these types to expose its state machines. The defined types may be subtyped to refine their behaviour.\nWhen a Server exposes its state machine using the types defined in this document, it might only provide a simplified view on its internal state machine, hiding for example substates or putting several internal states into one exposed state.\nThe scope of the state machines described in this document is to provide an appropriate foundation for state machines needed for[OPC 10000-9](/\u00A7UAPart9) and[OPC 10000-10](/\u00A7UAPart10). It does not provide more complex functionality of a state machine like parallel states, forks and joins, history states, choices and junctions, etc. However, the base state machine defined in this document can be extended to support such concepts.\nThe following clauses describe examples of state machines, define state machines in the context of this document and define the representation of state machines in OPC UA. Finally, some examples of state machines, represented in OPC UA, are given."

In the following, a more complex example is given, that also supports sub-state machines.\n[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref114466674) gives an overview over a simple state machine. It contains the three states \u0022State1\u0022, \u0022State2\u0022 and \u0022State3\u0022. There are transitions from \u0022State1\u0022 to \u0022State2\u0022, \u0022State2\u0022 to \u0022State2\u0022, etc. Some of the transitions provide additional information with regard to what causes (or triggers) the transition, for example the call of \u0022Method1\u0022 for the transition from \u0022State1\u0022 to \u0022State2\u0022. The effect (or action) of the transition can also be specified, for example the generation of an Event of the \u0022EventType1\u0022 in the same transition. The notation used to identify the cause is simply listing it on the transition, the effect is prefixed with a \u0022/\u0022. More than one cause or effect are separated by a \u0022,\u0022. Not every transition has to have a cause or effect, for example the transition between \u0022State2\u0022 and \u0022State3\u0022."

The intention is to keep the base simple but extensible.\nFor the state machines defined in this specification we assume that state machines are typed and instances of a type have their states and semantics specified by the type. For some types, this means that the states and transitions are fixed. For other types the states and transitions may be dynamic or unknown. A state machine where all the states are specified explicitly by the type is called a finite state machine.\nTherefore, we distinguish between StateMachineType and StateMachine and their subtypes like FiniteStateMachineType. The StateMachineType specifies a description of the state machine, that is, its states, transitions, etc., whereas the StateMachine is an instance of the StateMachineType and only contains the current state.\nEach StateMachine contains information about the current state. If the StateMachineType has SubStateMachines, the StateMachine also contains information about the current state of the SubStateMachines. StateMachines which have their states completely defined by the type are instances of a FiniteStateMachineType.\nEach FiniteStateMachineType has one or more States. For simplicity, we do not distinguish between different States like the start or the end states.\nEach State can have one or more SubStateMachines.\nEach FiniteStateMachineType may have one or more Transitions. A Transition is directed and points from one State to another State.\nEach Transition can have one or more Causes. A Cause leads a FiniteStateMachine to change its current State from the source of the Transition to its target. In this specification we only specify Method calls to be Causes of Transitions.

      "Content": "The StateMachineType is the base ObjectType for all StateMachineTypes. It defines a single Variable which represents the current state of the machine. An instance of this ObjectType shall generate an Event whenever a significant state change occurs. The Server decides which state changes are significant. Servers shall use the GeneratesEvent ReferenceType to indicate which Event(s) could be produced by the StateMachine.\nSubtypes may add Methods which affect the state of the machine. The Executable Attribute is used to indicate whether the Method is valid given the current state of the machine. The generation of AuditEvents for Methods is defined in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4). A StateMachine may not be active. In this case, the CurrentState and LastTransition Variables shall have a status equal to Bad_StateNotActive(see[Table 19](/\u00A7_Ref33078422)).\nSubtypes may add components which are instances of StateMachineTypes. These components are considered to be sub-states of the StateMachine. SubStateMachines are only active when the parent machine is in an appropriate state.\nEvents produced by SubStateMachines may be suppressed by the parent machine. In some cases, the parent machine will produce a single Event that reflects changes in multiple SubStateMachines.\nFiniteStateMachineType is a subtype of StateMachineType that provides a mechanism to explicitly define the states and transitions. A Server should use this mechanism if it knows what the possible states are and the state machine is not trivial.

Some additional rules apply for StateMachine types.\nStates and Transitions are not instantiated, this information is only provided on the ObjectType. They have no ModellingRule, and thus, also the inheritance of States and Transitions is not defined. Therefore, the following rules apply for subtyping StateMachines. Each State and Transition defined on the supertype shall be available on the subtype as well. That is, for each State defined on the supertype another Node of the same ObjectType having the same BrowseName and the same StateNumber shall be defined on the subtype. For each Transition defined on the supertype another Node of the same ObjectType having the same BrowseName and the same TransitionNumber shall be defined on the subtype. All references defining the StateMachine( HasCause, HasEffect, FromState, ToState, HasSubStateMachine, HasGuard) shall be replicated in the subtype as well. If InstanceDeclarations are referenced (e.g., Methods used to trigger Transitions) either the InstanceDeclaration of the supertype is referenced or the InstanceDeclaration is overridden, and in the latter case the overridden InstanceDeclaration of the subtype shall be referenced.\nIf a StateMachine type is not abstract, subtypes of it shall not change the behaviour of it. That means, that in this case a subtype shall not add States and it shall not add Transitions between its States. However, a subtype may add SubStateMachines, it may add Transitions from the States to the States of the SubStateMachine, and it may add Causes and Effects to a Transition. In addition, a subtype of a StateMachine type shall not remove States or Transitions."

      "Content": "The ChoiceStateType is a subtype of the StateType and is formally defined in[Table 20](/\u00A7_Ref51189834). An Object of the ChoiceStateType represents a pseudo state that is directly exited when it is entered. The Guards defined on the Transitions from the ChoiceState determine which Transition is used. The Guards shall be defined in a way that at least one Guard is true and a Transition can be determined. If this is not the case, the StateMachine is non-well formed. To avoid this, the specific ElseGuardVariableType can be used, which is only \u0022true\u0022 if all other Guards on a ChoiceState are \u0022false\u0022. If several Guards are \u0022true\u0022, only one of those Transitions is used. The algorithm to determine the Transition is server-specific.\nA sample StateMachine using a ChoiceState is given in[Figure 16](/\u00A7_Ref33080668). It provides a simplified representation of a robot. When the StateMachine is in the S1_Initial state, calling the Load() Method loads a program to the robot and triggers the Transition into the ChoiceState(CS). In the ChoiceState the Guards are validated and in case the robot is on the correct position for the loaded program (validated by the guard OnPath = True) the State S3_Ready is entered. In case the robot is not in the correct position (Else) the S2_Loaded State is entered. In that State, the Prepare() Method puts the robot in the correct position, and triggers the Transition to S3_Ready. If the robot is ready, it can be started. While it is running, it can be stopped. If the program is finished, the robot goes back to either the loaded or ready state, depending on its position, using the ChoiceState, again."
