The number of Subscribers receiving data from a Publisher does not influence the Publisher. This makes PubSub suitable for applications where location independence and/or scalability are required.\nThe following are some example uses for PubSub:\nConfigurable peer-to-peer communication between controllers and between controllers and HMIs. The peers are not directly connected and do not even need to know about the existence of each other. The data exchange often requires a fixed time-window; it may be point-to-point connection or data distribution to many receivers.\nAsynchronous workflows. For example, an order processing application can place an order on a message queue or an enterprise service bus. From there it can be processed by one or more workers.\nLogging to multiple systems. For example, sensors or actuators can write logs to a monitoring system, an HMI, an archive application for later querying, and so on.\nOPC UA Servers representing services or devices can stream data to applications hosted in the cloud. For example, backend servers, big data analytics for system optimization and predictive maintenance."

The concrete transport protocol mappings and message mappings are specified in Clause[7](/\u00A7_Ref502872169).\nDefined with these abstraction layers, PubSub can be used to transport different types of information through networks with different characteristics as illustrated with two examples:\nPubSub with UDP transport and binary encoded messages may be well-suited in production environments for frequent transmission of small amounts of data. It also allows data exchange in one-to-one and one-to-many configurations.\nThe use of established standard messaging protocols like MQTT with JSON data encoding supports the cloud integration path and readily allows handling of the information in modern stream and batch analytics systems."

Similarly, Subscribers express interest in specific types of data, and process messages that contain this data, without knowledge of what Publishers there are.\nMessage Oriented Middleware is software or hardware infrastructure that supports sending and receiving messages between distributed systems. The implementation of this distribution depends on the Message Oriented Middleware.\n[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref460935940) illustrates that Publishers and Subscribers only interact with the Message Oriented Middleware which provides the means to forward the data to one or more receivers."

Subscribers and Publishers use standard messaging protocols like MQTT to communicate with the Broker. All messages are published to specific queues (e.g. topics, nodes) that the Broker exposes and Subscribers can listen to these queues. The Broker may translate messages from the formal messaging protocol of the Publisher to the formal messaging protocol of the Subscriber."

Quite typically, a Publisher will be an OPC UA Server(the owner of information) and a Subscriber is often an OPC UA Client. Above all, the PubSub Information Model for configuration (see[9](/\u00A7_Ref497838497)) promotes the configuration of Publishers and Subscribers using the OPC UA Client Server model.\nNevertheless, the PubSub communication does not require such a role dependency. I.e., OPC UA Clients can be Publishers and OPC UA Servers can be Subscribers. In fact, there is no necessity for Publishers or Subscribers to be either an OPC UA Server or an OPC UA Client to participate in PubSub communications.\nMore details on how Subscriptions in the Client Server communication model compare to PubSub are described in[Annex C](/\u00A7_Ref28421088)."

Their primary relation is the shared understanding of specific types of data ( DataSets), the publish characteristics of messages that include these data, and the Message Oriented Middleware.\nThe \u0022messages\u0022 in[Figure 2](/\u00A7_Ref452383558) represent NetworkMessages. Each NetworkMessage includes header information (e.g. identification and security data) and one or more DataSetMessages(the payload). The DataSetMessages may be signed and encrypted in accordance with the configured message security. A Security Key Server is responsible for the distribution of the security keys needed for message security. In addition, the transport may supply security for certain protocol mappings.\nEach DataSetMessage is created from a DataSet. A component of a Publisher called DataSetWriter generates a continuous sequence of DataSetMessages. Syntax and semantics of DataSets are described by DataSetMetaData. The selection of information for a DataSet in the Publisher and the data acquisition parameters are called PublishedDataSet. DataSet, DataSetMetaData and PublishedDataSet are detailed in[5.2](/\u00A7_Ref451847416).\nPublishers and Subscribers are typically configured through a configuration tool. The configuration can be done through a generic OPC UA PubSub configuration tool using the PubSub configuration Information Model defined in Clause[9](/\u00A7_Ref497838497) or through product-specific configuration tools. To support the PubSub configuration Information Model, Publishers and Subscribers must be also OPC UA Server.\nNOTE The PubSub directory is an optional entity that allows Publishers to advertise their PublishedDataSets and their communication parameters. This directory functionality is planned for a future version of this document."

The parameters define for example when and how often to trigger the sending sequence and the encoding and security of the messages. The PubSub communication parameters are defined in Clause[6](/\u00A7_Ref462847659).\nThe first step is the collection of data ( DataSet) to be published. The configuration for such a collection is called PublishedDataSet. The PublishedDataSet also defines the DataSetMetaData. Collection is a generic expression for various different options, like monitoring of Variables in an OPC UA Server AddressSpace, processing OPC UA Events, or for example reading data from network packets. In the end, the collection process produces values for the individual fields of a DataSet. The two concrete PublishedDataSet options with standard OPC UA configuration are PublishedDataItems for Variable base collection and PublishedEvents for Event based collection.\nIn the next step, a DataSetWriter takes the DataSet and creates a DataSetMessage. DataSetMessages from DataSetWriters in one WriterGroup can be inserted into a single NetworkMessage. The creation of a DataSetMessage is guided by the following parameters:\nThe DataSetFieldContentMask(see[6.2.4.2](/\u00A7_Ref495515956)) controls which attributes of a value shall be encoded.\nThe DataSetMessageContentMask(see[6.3.1.3.2](/\u00A7_Ref494354861)) controls which header fields shall be encoded.\nThe KeyFrameCount(see[6.2.4.3](/\u00A7_Ref494234143)) greater than or equal to 1 controls whether a key frame or a delta frame DataSetMessage is to be created.

Such a connection may simply be a multi-cast address when using OPC UA UDP or a connection to a message Broker when using MQTT. Once subscribed, the Subscriber will start listening. The sequence starts when a NetworkMessage is received. The Subscriber may have configured filters (like a PublisherId, DataSetWriterId or a DataSetClassId) so that it can drop all messages that do not match the filter.\nOnce a NetworkMessage has been accepted, it is decrypted and decoded. The security parameters are the same as for the Publisher.\nEach DataSetMessage of interest is passed on to a DataSetReader. Here, the DataSetMetaData is used to decode the DataSetMessage content to a DataSet. The DataSetMetaData in particular provides the complete field syntax including the name, data type, and other relevant Properties like engineering units. Version information that exists in both the DataSetMessage and the DataSetMetaData allows the Subscriber to detect version changes. If a major change occurs, the Subscriber needs to get an updated DataSetMetaData.\nAny further processing is application-specific. For example, an additional dispatching step may map the received values to Nodes in the Subscribers OPC UA AddressSpace. The configuration for such a dispatching is called SubscribedDataSet. The two concrete SubscribedDataSet options with standard OPC UA configuration are TargetVariables and SubscribedDataSetMirror. The configuration of TargetVariables allows the dispatching of DataSetMessage fields to existing Variables in the Subscribers OPC UA AddressSpace. The configuration of SubscribedDataSetMirror is used if the received DataSet fields should be represented as Variables in the Subscribers OPC UA AddressSpace but the Variables do not exist and must be created as part of the Subscriber configuration."

For each DataSet a DataSetMessage is created. The DataSetMessages are sent in a NetworkMessage to the IP multicast address.\nOPC UA Applications like HMI applications would use the values of the DataSetMessage that they are interested in.\nAn OPC UA Application that maps data fields from UADP DataSetMessages to internal Variables can be configured through the DataSetReader Object and dispatcher in the Subscriber. The configuration of a DataSetReader defines how to decode the DataSetMessage to a DataSet. The SubscribedDataSet defines which field in the DataSet is mapped to which Variable in the OPC UA Application.\nWith OPC UA UDP there is no guarantee of timeliness, delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. The sequence numbers in DataSetMessages provide a solution for ordering and duplicate detection. The reliability is improved by the option to send the complete DataSet in every DataSetMessage or with the option to repeat NetworkMessages.\nOther transport protocol mappings used with the broker-less model could provide guarantee of timeliness, delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection."

Each group may have one or more DataSetWriters that format a DataSet as required for the messaging protocol. A DataSet can be collected from a list of Event fields and/or selected Variables. Such a configuration is called PublishedDataSet.\nEach DataSet is sent as a separate DataSetMessage serialized with a format that depends on the DataSetWriter. One DataSetMessage format is the JSON message mapping which represents the DataSet in a format which Subscribers can understand without knowledge of OPC UA. Another DataSetMessage format is the UADP message mapping.\nMessage confidentiality and integrity with the Broker based communication model can be ensured at two levels:\ntransport security between Publishers or Subscribers and the Broker, or\nmessage security as end-to-end security between Publisher and Subscriber.\nThe Broker level security requires all Publishers and Subscribers to have credentials that grant them access to the necessary queue or topic. In addition, all communication with the Broker uses transport level security to ensure confidentiality. The security parameters are specified on the connection and group.\nThe message security provided by the Publisher is only defined for the UADP message mapping."

The value of the PublisherId is typically shared between PubSubConnections but the assignment of the PublisherId is vendor specific.\nThe PublisherId parameter is only relevant for the Publisher functionality inside a PubSubConnection. The filter setting on the Subscriber side is contained in the DataSetReader parameters.\nValid DataTypes are UInteger and String. A zero UInteger and a Null or empty String are invalid PublisherIds.\nThe default PublisherId for datagram transport protocols has a DataType of UInt64. If the default PublisherId is created by the OPC UA Application, it is recommended to set the first 6 bytes with the MAC address of one of the network interfaces and to set the two remaining bytes to the OPC UA Server port of the OPC UA Application.\nThe default PublisherId for broker based transports equals the PublisherId for datagram transport protocols but the DataType is UInt64 for UADP message mapping and String for JSON message mapping. For the String, the UInt64 value is converted to a String. The PublisherId may be used in message headers, as part of a QueueName or as a client identifier for the broker connection. In these cases the size of the PublisherId and the characters used in the PublisherId may have limitations or impact to the communication performance.\nThe default PublisherId is used if it is not assigned by a configuration tool."

This affects encoding NodeIds in ExtensionObjects but also all other namespace indices in NodeIds and BrowseNames contained in the messages. If the Subscriber receives Structure DataTypes where the target Variables DataTypes have the same structure but different DataType NodeIds, the Subscriber must verify the consistency of the layout at start-up and must map the complete encoding NodeId when receiving the data.\nThe Subscriber should verify that the target Variables can handle array and string sizes if the Subscriber has limits and the DataSetMetaData contains size information. This includes ArrayDimensions and MaxStringLength information in the FieldMetaData and the StructureFields of Structure DataTypes. The verification should be executed at the start-up of the DataSetReader and when the DataSetMetaData is updated.

One reason is the reservation of space inside a NetworkMessage by setting ConfiguredSize to a higher value than the assigned DataSet actually requires.

The available protocol mappings are defined in[7.3](/\u00A7_Ref463039180).\nThe UADP message mapping defines different optional header fields, variations of field settings and different DataSetMessage types and data encodings. Available layouts with standard settings and the corresponding URI Strings for UADP are defined in[A.2](/\u00A7_Ref128034075).\nSome optional fields like timestamps provide information that is not necessary for the processing of the messages on the Subscriber side. Other optional fields like PublisherId, DataSetWriterId or sizes of DataSetMessages are typically necessary for the processing of messages in generic Subscribers. If such fields are not present, the Subscriber must know the missing information from the DataSetReader configuration. One scenario is that a Publisher is sending NetworkMessages with a fixed layout of the payload. In this case the DataSetWriterId, the offset and size of the DataSetMessages is known from the DataSetReader configuration. The identification is done in this case by the group header with the WriterGroupId and NetworkMessageNumber. The UADP-Periodic-Fixed header layout for this scenario is defined in[A.2.1](/\u00A7_Ref128033941).\nThe flexibility of the optional fields is necessary to support different use cases but it also allows the configuration of invalid combinations. To reduce the number of combinations used in common use cases,[Annex A](/\u00A7_Ref1981270) defines standard UADP header layouts with defined settings for common use cases.

This handling of information flows and status codes assumes that the configuration between Publisher and Subscriber is in sync.\nIn several combinations of settings for the DataSetMessages and NetworkMessages, a Subscriber is able to process received messages without further knowledge of the Publisher side configuration. But most Subscribers need at least the DataSetMetaData to be able to process the received DataSetMessages.\nThe Publisher side configuration implies two types of contracts necessary for the Subscriber to process messages. The one type of contract is the DataSetMetaData describing the content of a DataSetMessage. The other type of contract provides the communication settings like the DataSetWriterId or offsets inside NetworkMessages. Both type of contracts provide version information that can be included into the DataSetMessages and NetworkMessages.\nSeveral settings in the contracts have corresponding flags or version fields in the messages and a Subscriber can detect mismatches between the contract and the received messages.\nThe error handling depends on the Subscriber applications. Subscribers that are configured to process certain DataSetMessages often work with a known contract and they will typically drop messages that do not comply with the contract. At the same time they will try to get an update of the contract and will try to adjust its own settings to the updated contract if this is possible. Some changes may need manual reconfiguration of the Subscriber."

They are sent by the Publisher in the case of a configuration change. A Publisher can also be configured to send the discovery announcement messages periodically. A Message Oriented Middleware may be able to persist the latest announcement message for Subscribers.\nDiscovery probe messages are sent from Subscriber to Publisher and they are limited to Message Oriented Middleware and protocol mappings that support such a back channel. A discovery probe is typically answered with one or more discovery announcement messages.\nDepending on the used Message Oriented Middleware and the protocol mapping, it may be possible and required for the Subscriber to request discovery announcement messages by sending discovery probe messages. One use case is a non reliable transport where the Subscriber did not receive the message or the Subscriber was not available at the time the Publisher sent the discovery announcement. Another use case is the collection of initial knowledge about a Publisher. Some discovery announcement messages may only be sent as result of a discovery probe message."

      "Content": "[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) defines two DataEncodings: CompactEncoding and VerboseEncoding. They have the same structure except VerboseEncoding includes default values.\nThe main use case for the VerboseEncoding is the payload of DataSetMessages. The VerboseEncoding and the following rules for DataSet field encoding ensure that Subscribers without OPC UA knowledge get messages without OPC UA specific information for normal use cases. At the same time, the rules for special cases and abstract data types ensure that OPC UA aware Subscribers can fully reverse the payload to OPC UA DataTypes if they have access to the DataSetMetaData of the Publisher. The rules for the special cases are defined in[7.2.5.4.3](/\u00A7_Ref202278699). VerboseEncoding is the recommended default encoding for DataSetMessages.\nThis specification defines a DataSet field encoding for the VerboseEncoding which simplifies the encoding of Variants and ExtensionObjects by omitting UaType and UaTypeId fields with concrete DataType defined in the FieldMetaData. In this case the Variants at the top level are collapsed. Therefore the DataSet fields in a DataSetMessage for VerboseEncoding are encoded like the fields of a Structure where the fields are described by the FieldMetaData. This includes fields with Enumeration DataTypes which are encoded using verbose Enumeration with the definition in the FieldMetaData.\nThe additional simplification for VerboseEncoding only applies to the first level of the DataSet fields. For the nested fields in structure DataSet fields, the rules of VerboseEncoding defined in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) apply.\nThe following example shows a DataSetMessage with VerboseEncoding and DataSet fields without field specific status and timestamps.\n{\n\u0022PublisherId\u0022:\u0022MyPublisher\u0022,\n\u0022DataSetWriterId\u0022:102,"

IGMP messages are also used by switches capable of supporting \u0022IGMP snooping\u0022 whereby the switch listens to IGMP messages and only sends the multicast NetworkMessages to ports that have joined the multicast group. The corresponding protocol for IPv6 is the Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD).There are different versions of IGMP and MLD:   - IGMP V1 is defined in IETF RFC 1112.   - IGMP V2 is defined in IETF RFC 2236.   - IGMP V3 is defined in IETF RFC 3376.\n- IGMP V3 and MLD V2 are defined in IETF RFC 4604.\nIETF RFC 2236 and IETF RFC 3376 discuss host and router requirements for interoperation with older IGMP versions.If OPC UA devices make extensive use of IP multicast for UDP transport, consistent IGMP and MLD usage by OPC UA devices is essential in order to create well-functioning OPC UA Application networks.\nOPC UA Applications shall issue an IGMP membership report message (V1, V2 or V3 as appropriate) for IPv4 or a MLD membership report message for IPv6 when enabling a PubSub connection on which they will receive UDP multicast NetworkMessages."

The format of a MAC address is six groups of hexadecimal digits, separated by hyphens (e.g. 01-23-45-67-89-ab). A system may also accept hostnames and/or IP addresses if it provides means to resolve it to a MAC address (e.g. DNS and Reverse-ARP).\nThe VID is the VLAN ID as number.\nThe PCP is the Priority Code Point as one digit number.

      "Content": "MQTT is an open standard application layer protocol for Message Oriented Middleware. MQTT is often used with a Broker that relays messages between applications that cannot communicate directly.\nPublishers send MQTT messages to MQTT brokers. Subscribers subscribe to MQTT brokers for messages. A Broker may persist messages so they can be delivered even if the Subscriber is not online. Brokers may also allow messages to be sent to multiple Subscribers.\nThe MQTT protocol defines a binary protocol used to send and receive messages from and to topics. The body is an opaque binary blob that can contain any data serialized using an encoding chosen by the application.\nThere are currently two versions of the MQTT protocol in use, version 3.1.1 and version 5.0. Version 5.0 expands on version 3.1.1 by adding support for connection and message properties. This enables advanced routing scenarios at the broker level in particular when using encrypted payloads.\nThis document defines two possible encodings for the message body: the binary encoded DataSetMessage defined in[7.2.3](/\u00A7_Ref463016249) and a JSON encoded DataSetMessage defined in[7.2.4.6.9](/\u00A7_Ref463017146).\nMQTT version 3.1.1 does not provide a mechanism for specifying the encoding of the MQTT message which means the Subscribers need to be configured in advance with knowledge of the expected encoding. As a consequence, Publishers should only publish NetworkMessages using a single encoding to a unique MQTT topic name.\nMQTT version 5.0 adds the encoding and the message type information to the message and connection header and therefore allows Subscribers to detect the encoding and the message mapping. No additional information is added to the meta data messages."

For that reason, it may be necessary to provide end-to-end message security. Applications that require end-to-end message security with MQTT need to use the UADP NetworkMessages and binary message encoding defined in[7.2.3](/\u00A7_Ref463016249).

An instance of PublishedDataSetType has a list of DataSetWriters used to produce DataSetMessages sent via the Message Oriented Middleware. The DataSetMetaData describes the content of a DataSet.\nInstances of the PubSubConnectionType represent settings associated with Message Oriented Middleware. A connection manages a list of WriterGroupType Objects and transport protocol mapping specific parameters.\nInstances of the WriterGroupType contain instances of DataSetWriter Objects that share settings such as security configuration, encoding or timing of NetworkMessages. A group manages a list of DataSetWriterType Objects that define the payload of the NetworkMessages created from the group settings.\nDataSetWriters represent the configuration necessary to create DataSetMessages contained as payload in NetworkMessages.\nDataSetReaders represent the configuration necessary to receive and process DataSetMessages on the Subscriber side.\nNetworkMessages are sent through a transport like MQTT or OPC UA UDP. Other transport protocols can be added as subtypes without changing the base model.\nThe definition of the PubSub related ObjectTypes does not prescribe how the instances are created or configured or how dynamic the configuration can be. A Publisher may have a preconfigured number of PublishedDataSets and DataSetWriters where only protocol-specific settings can be configured.

It should delay access in the range of timeout settings for Method calls.\nThe online PubSub configuration was updated in OPC UA 1.05 to the atomic update capability through the PubSubConfiguration Object. This option replaced the deprecated individual PubSub configuration Methods.\nConfiguration changes with the deprecated Methods must be applied in a batch to avoid inconsistencies between different configuration parameters.

The header layouts only apply to NetworkMessages with DataSetMessages.\nWhile this flexibility makes it possible to support many different use cases with PubSub, the number of possible header field combinations also increases the effort needed for the implementation and verification. On the other hand, within a given application domain or for different use cases some configurations might be more appropriate than others. The header layouts described in this section intend to find a reasonable set of header options to provide a compromise between flexibility, interoperability and optimized support for different use cases.\nCustom configurations for the possible header field combinations can be used but they should be limited to applications that do not fall into the use cases described for the following layouts."

In such a use case, the layout of the data that needs to be transferred is the same in every PublishingInterval. When the message layout is the same in every PublishingInterval, and the Subscriber knows this in advance, several optimizations are possible:\nBoth Publisher and the Subscriber can be optimized for sending and receiving messages with a fixed layout, therefore offsets of send/receive fields can be pre-calculated based on the configuration.\nCertain encodings may result in varying size of DataSetMessages, which requires extra fields in the messages to allow the Subscriber to parse these messages. These extra fields can be omitted when the size of the DataSetMessages is constant.\nThe header layout described in this section is optimized for this use case."

This implies the following:\nEach NetworkMessage contains the same number of DataSetMessages\nThe sequence of the DataSetMessages within a NetworkMessage is the same in every PublishingInterval\nThe layout of the fields within every DataSetMessage is the same in every PublishingInterval\nNote: These assumptions have to be fulfilled by appropriate configuration of the Publisher.\nSubscribers have to know the static message layout in advance. This means all fields in the headers which would be required for ad-hoc parsing of messages with dynamic layout can be omitted (e.g. PayloadHeader or Sizes).\nFinally, a Subscriber needs an easy way to verify that a received message matches the expected message layout. Fields of the NetworkMessage header and the GroupHeader will be used for this purpose.\nPublisherId and WriterGroupId identify the WriterGroup. The NetworkMessageNumber is important for WriterGroups which distribute their DataSets over more than one NetworkMessage, and the GroupVersion allows the Subscriber to verify the expected layout of the DataSetMessages and their DataSet fields."

This allows a highly efficient encoding and decoding of the message because the offset of all fields is constant and can be pre-calculated. The Payload Header( Count and Sizes for the DataSetMessages and DataSetWriterIds) is deactivated and the Subscriber has to retrieve this information through the DataSetMetaData, DataSetWriter and WriterGroup settings.\nThe configuration has to ensure that the size of each DataSetMessage is constant. This can be achieved by avoiding DataSet fields of types with variable size, or by using the parameter ConfiguredSize. In this example it is assumed that DataSetMessage[1] and DataSetMessage[W-1] are using RawData field encoding and all DataSet fields are from constant size, so the total length of theses DataSetMessages can be calculated from the DataSetMetaData. For DataSetMessage[0] in this example the Subscriber does not have to calculate the total length but it should take it from the parameter ConfiguredSize. This allows to provide spare bytes for future extension of DataSetMessage[0] without effect on the size of the complete NetworkMessage or the position of other DataSetMessages in this NetworkMessage.\nBy setting-specific values for KeyFrameCount and DataSetOrdering(see[Table A.6](/\u00A7_Ref532478975)) it is guaranteed that the number of DataSetMessages and their order inside the NetworkMessage is the same in every NetworkMessage that is sent."

This section describes how OPC UA PubSub can be bound to Kafka, a distributed streaming platform that allows publishers and subscribers to exchange messages through topics. Kafka is widely used for data integration, stream processing, and event-driven applications.\nThe transport protocol binding of OPC UA to Kafka is based on the following assumptions and conventions:\nKafka brokers are used to manage the topics and partitions, and to store the messages.\nKafka producers are used to publish OPC UA NetworkMessages to Kafka topics. Topics must be created in the broker before they can be used by producers.\nKafka consumers are used to subscribe to Kafka topics and receive OPC UA NetworkMessages.\nKafka topics are configured throgh QueueNames in WriterGroups, DataSetWriters and DataSetReaders.\nA[Broker](https://reference.opcfoundation.org/search/54?t=Broker) may persist messages so they can be delivered even if the subscriber is not online.\nKafka security is applied at the transport level, using the SSL/TLS or SASL mechanisms supported by Kafka. The Kafka security configuration is independent of the OPC UA security configuration and can be used to provide an additional layer of protection.\nThe OPC UA PubSub transport protocol mapping for Kafka enables the integration of OPC UA PubSub with Kafka-based systems, and the use of Kafka as a reliable and scalable transport for OPC UA PubSub."

      "Content": "The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for Message Oriented Middleware. AMQP is often used with a Broker that relays messages between applications that cannot communicate directly.\nPublishers send AMQP messages to AMQP endpoints. Subscribers listen to AMQP endpoints for incoming messages. If a Broker is involved it may persist messages so they can be delivered even if the subscriber is not online. Brokers may also allow messages to be sent to multiple Subscribers.\nThe AMQP protocol defines a binary encoding for all messages with a header and a body. The header allows applications to insert additional information as name-value pairs that are serialized using the AMQP binary encoding. The body is an opaque binary blob that can contain any data serialized using an encoding chosen by the application.\nThis document defines two possible message mappings for the AMQP message body: the UADP message mapping defined in[7.2.3](/\u00A7_Ref463016249) and a JSON message mapping defined in[7.2.4.6.9](/\u00A7_Ref463017146). AMQP Brokers have an upper limit on message size. The limit is defined by the AMQP field max-message-size. The mechanism for handling NetworkMessages that exceed the Broker limits depends on the MessageMapping. For MessageMappings that support chunking, the NetworkMessage is broken into multiple chunks. The chunk size plus the AMQP header should not exceed the AMQP max-message-size. For MessageMappings that do not support chunking, the NetworkMessages exceeding the maximum size mut be skipped. Diagnostic information for such error scenarios are provided through the Events of the type PubSubTransportLimitsExceedEventType defined in[9.1.13.2](/\u00A7_Ref443423505) and through the FailedTransmissions counter of the"
