      "Content": "This part describes the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) security model. It describes the security threats of the physical, hardware, and software environments in which OPC UA is expected to run. It describes how OPC UA relies upon other standards for security. It provides definition of common security terms that are used in this and other parts of the OPC UA specification series. It provides an overview of general security features. It also relates these features to the security concepts that are specified in other parts of the OPC UA specification. It references services, mappings, and Profiles that are specified normatively in other parts of this multi-part specification. It provides suggestions or best practice guidelines on implementing security. Any seeming ambiguity between this document and one of the other normative documents in this series does not remove or reduce the requirement specified in the other normative document.\nThere are many different aspects of security that are addressed when developing applications. However, since OPC UA specifies a communication protocol, the focus is on securing the data exchanged between applications. This does not mean that an application developer can ignore the other aspects of security like protecting persistent data against tampering. It is important that the developers investigate all aspects of security and decide how they can be addressed in the application.\nThis document is directed to readers who will develop OPC UA Applications. It is also for end Users that wish to understand the various security features and functionality provided by OPC UA. It also offers some suggestions that can be applied when deploying systems. These suggestions are generic in nature since the details would depend on the actual implementation of the OPC UA Applications and the choices made for the site security."

Only entity \u0022B\u0022 has the matching Private Key that is needed to decrypt the data. In an asymmetric Digital Signature algorithm when an entity \u0022A\u0022 requires message Integrity or to provide Authentication for data sent to entity \u0022B\u0022, entity A uses its Private Key to sign the data. To verify the signature, entity B uses the matching Public Key that entity A has provided. In an asymmetric key agreement algorithm, entity A and entity B each send their own Public Key to the other entity. Then each uses their own Private Key and the other\u0027s Public Key to compute the new key value.\u0027 according to[IS Glossary](/\u00A7ISGlossary).\nNote 2 to entry: Asymmetric Cryptography is also known as Public Key Cryptography.

      "Content": "OPC UA is a protocol used between components in the operation of an industrial facility at multiple levels: from high-level enterprise management to low-level direct process control of a device. The use of OPC UA for enterprise management involves dealings with customers and suppliers. It could be an attractive target for industrial espionage or sabotage and could also be exposed to threats through untargeted malware, such as worms, circulating on public networks. Disruption of communications at the process control could result in financial losses, affect employee and public safety or cause environmental damage.\nOPC UA will be deployed in a diverse range of operational environments with varying assumptions about threats and accessibility, and with a variety of security policies and enforcement regimes. OPC UA, therefore, provides a flexible set of security mechanisms.[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref135816426) is a composite that shows a combination of such environments. Some OPC UA Applications are on the same host and can be easily protected from external attack. Some OPC UA Applications are on different hosts in the same operations network and could be protected by the security boundary protections that separate the operations network from external connections. Some OPC UA Applications run in relatively open environments where users and applications could be difficult to control. Other OPC UA Applications are embedded in control systems that have no direct electronic connection to external systems. OPC UA also supports multiple protocols and communication technologies, that could require different levels of security and different security infrastructure. For example, both Client- Server and Publisher- Subscriber communication is shown in[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref135816426). OPC UA also defines global services such as Certificate management, KeyCredential management, AuthorizationService, and GlobalDiscoveryServer(GDS) to help manage security and other global functionality."

Flooding attacks can be conducted at multiple layers including OPC UA, HTTP or TCP.\nMessage flooding attacks can also target a Client, although this is less of a risk, since the Client chooses who to connect to. A Client could receive a flood from a compromised Server which could disrupt the OPC UA Application.\nMessage flooding attacks can use both well-formed and malformed Message s. In the first scenario, the attacker could be a malicious person using a legitimate Client to flood the Server with requests. Two cases exist, one in which the Client does not have a Session with the Server and one in which it does. Message flooding can impair the ability to establish OPC UA Sessions or terminate an existing Session. In the second scenario, an attacker could use a malicious Client that floods an OPC UA Server with malformed Messages in order to exhaust the Server\u0027s resources.\nFor PubSub, an attacker can send a large volume of dataset messages with the goal of overwhelming the subscriber, the middleware or dependent components such as CPU, TCP/IP stack, operating system, or the file system. Flooding attacks can be conducted at multiple layers including OPC UA, UDP, AMQP, MQTT.\nAs in Client- Server, PubSub message flooding attacks can use both well-formed and malformed Messages. For well-formed Messages, the attacker could be one in which the publisher is not a member of the SecurityGroup and one in which it is a member. For malformed Messages, an attacker could use a malicious Publisher that floods a network with malformed Messages in order to exhaust the system\u0027s resources.\nIn general,"

The commands are typically valid, but they each use up a resource resulting in a single Client obtaining all resources blocking valid Clients from accessing the Server. For example, on a Server in which only 10 Sessions are available a malicious person using a legitimate Client, could obtain all 10 Sessions. Or a malicious Client could try to open 10 SecureChannel s, without actually completing the process.The Client might not even open a Session, just open a socket to the Server.\nResource exhaustion attacks do not occur in the same manner for PubSub communications since no session or resources are allocated. For PubSub communication, the Publisher is not susceptible. In broker-less PubSub communication, the Subscriber can, with the use of filters, bypass any resource exhaustion issues. In broker case, both the Publisher and Subscriber are connected to the broker. Although the Publisher and Subscriber are not directly susceptible (as in the broker-less case), the broker is susceptible. The details for broker communication is not part of this standard but is defined by the broker protocol.\nThe resource exhaustion could also be related to logging or diagnostics. In this case, a Client makes an incorrect request to open a channel or socket and repeats the request often enough to trigger excessive logging. The logging could burden or exceed resources."

Boundary protections, shown as abstract examples in[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref135816426), can include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, controls on dial-in connections, and controls on media and computers that are brought into the system. Protections in components of the system can include hardened configuration of the operating systems, security patch management, anti-virus programs, and not allowing email in the control network.

A Session in the application layer communicates over a SecureChannel that is created in the communication layer and relies upon it for secure communication. All of the Session data is passed to the communication layer for further processing.\nAlthough a Session communicates over a SecureChannel and has to be activated before it can be used, the binding of users, Sessions, and SecureChannels is flexible.\nImpersonation allows a user to take ownership of an existing Session.\nIf a SecureChannel breaks, the Session will remain valid for a period of time allowing the Client to re-establish the connection to the Session via a new SecureChannel. Otherwise, the Session closes after its lifetime expires. The requirements for re-establishing connections are described in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4)"

One essential mechanism to meet these security objectives is to establish a SecureChannel(see[4.13](/\u00A7_Ref183424960)) that is used to secure the communication between a Client and a Server. The SecureChannel provides encryption to maintain Confidentiality, Message Signatures to maintain Integrity and Certificates to provide application Authentication. In addition, the SecureChannel provides Perfect Forward Secrecy when the SecureChannel is used with Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and the Diffie Hellman Key Exchange. The data that comes from the Application Layer is secured and passes the \u0022secured\u0022 data to the Transport Layer. The security mechanisms that are managed by the Communication Layer are provided by the SecureChannel Services that are specified in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4).\nThe security mechanisms provided by the SecureChannel services are implemented by a protocol stack that is chosen for the implementation. Mappings of the services to some of the protocol stack options are specified in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) which define how functions in the protocol stack are used to meet the OPC UA security objectives.

      "Content": "The broker-less PubSub communication model provides Confidentiality and Integrity. This is accomplished using Symmetric Encryption and signature algorithms. The required SymmetricKeys are distributed by a Security Key Server (SKS) (see[OPC 10000-14](/\u00A7UAPart14) for additional details). The SKS makes use of the standard Client/ Server security described in[4.5.2](/\u00A7_Ref106764472) to establish application Authentication as well as user Authentication. This approach allows all applications ( Publishers and/or Subscribers) in a SecurityGroup to share information. An SKS could be part of a Publisher or Subscriber. It could also be a centrally managed SKS that is part of a GDS. A key point related to SymmetricKeys is that they will need to be replaced periodically, where the period is determined by the number of Publishers in a SecurityGroup and the frequency of messages. To ensure that Publishers and Subscribers can maintain communication, they need to be able to interact with an SKS. The SKS can push keys to a Server and a Client can pull keys from the SKS.\nSee[OPC 10000-14](/\u00A7UAPart14) for more details on an SKS.\nA benefit of using shared SymmetricKeys is the high performance they offer, but a drawback is that for a group of applications that use a shared SymmetricKey, all of the applications in the group have the same rights. All applications must trust all other applications in the group. Any application ( Publisher or Subscriber) in the group can publish a message and any application ( Publisher or Subscriber) in the group can decode the message.\nFor example, a system could be composed of a shared symmetric group that is composed of a controller ( Publisher) and three Subscribers"

If one of the HMIs is compromised, it could start publishing messages also. The other two HMIs will not be able to tell that the message was not sent from the controller. One possible solution to this situation could be if the shared symmetric group is composed of just the controller and one HMI. Additional groups would be created for each HMI, then no HMI could affect the other HMIs. Other possible solutions could also involve the network architecture and services, such as unicast restricted network communication, but these are outside the scope of the OPC UA specification.

Furthermore, communication to the Broker can be secured according the rules defined for the Broker. These rules are not defined in the OPC UA specification but are defined by the Middleware. In many cases the Middleware requires the authorization of both the Publishers and the Subscribers before they can interact with the Broker. The Broker interactions can provide security mechanisms to meet Confidentiality, Integrity and application or user Authentication as security objectives.

The available security policies are specified in[OPC 10000-7](/\u00A7UAPart7). The Administrator can at a later time also change or modify the selection of allowed SecurityPolicies as circumstances dictate.\nThe announcement of security policies is handled by special discovery services specified in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4).

The challenge of the SecureChannel establishment is that it requires the Client and the Server to securely exchange cryptographic keys and secret information in an insecure environment, therefore a specific Key Exchange Algorithm(similar to TLS Handshake protocol defined in[TLS](/\u00A7Tls)) is applied by the communication participants.\nOnce established, a SecureChannel uses Symmetric Cryptography keys to encrypt and sign all Messages. Symmetric Cryptography requires a shared key. Asymmetric Cryptography is used to create this shared key.\nThe OPC UA Client retrieves the security policies and Certificates of the OPC UA Server by the previously mentioned discovery services. These Certificates contain the Public Keys of the OPC UA Server.\nFor Rivest-Shamir-Adleman(RSA) the following procedure is used:\nThe OPC UA Client sends its Public Key in a Certificate"

This Message is secured by applying Asymmetric Encryption with the Server\u0027s Public Key and by generating Asymmetric Signatures with the Client\u0027s Private Key. However, the Certificate is sent unencrypted so that the receiver can use it to verify the Asymmetric Signature.\nThe Server decrypts the Message with its Private Key and verifies the Asymmetric Signature with the Client\u0027s Public Key. The secret information of the OPC UA Client together with the secret information of the OPC UA Server is used to derive a set of cryptographic keys that are used for securing all further Message s. Furthermore, all other service Messages are secured with Symmetric Encryption and Symmetric Signatures instead of the asymmetric equivalents.\nThe Server sends its secret information in the service response to the Client so that the Client can derive the same set of SymmetricKeys.\nFor ECC the following procedure is used:\nThe OPC UA Client generates a new temporary key pair and sends the Public Key to the Server.\nThe Server verifies the signature on the request, then generates a new temporary key pair and sends the Public Key to the Client.\nOnce the Public Keys are exchanged, both the Server and Client derive the SymmetricKeys needed for the secure conversation.\nSince Clients and Servers have the same set of cryptographic keys they can communicate securely with each other. The SymmetricKeys used in communication can be deciphered if enough messages using the SymmetricKeys are collected and analysed. These derived cryptographic keys are required to be changed periodically so that attackers do not have unlimited time and unrestricted sequences of Messages to use to determine what the SymmetricKeys are.

      "Content": "Clients and Servers generate audit records of successful and unsuccessful connection attempts, results of security option negotiations, configuration changes, system changes, user interactions and Session rejections.\nOPC UA provides support for security audit trails through two mechanisms.\nFirst, it provides for traceability between Client and Server audit logs. The Client generates an audit log entry for an operation that includes a request. When the Client issues a service request, it generates an audit log entry and includes the local identifier of the log entry in the request sent to the Server. The Server logs requests that it receives and includes the Client\u0027s entry id in its audit log entry. In this fashion, if a security-related problem is detected at the Server, the associated Client audit log entry can be located and examined. OPC UA does not require the audit entries to be written to disk, but it does require that they be available. OPC UA provides the capability for Servers to generate Event Notifications that report auditable Events to Clients capable of processing and logging them. See[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4) for more details on how services in OPC UA are audited.\nSecond, OPC UA defines audit parameters to be included in audit records. This promotes consistency across audit logs and in Audit Events.[OPC 10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) defines the data types for these parameters. Other information models can extend the audit definitions.[OPC 10000-7](/\u00A7UAPart7) describes Profiles which include the ability to generate Audit Events and use these parameters, including the Client audit record id."

      "Content": "OPC UA minimizes the loss of Availability caused by Message flooding by minimizing the amount of processing done with a Message before the Message is authenticated. This prevents an attacker from leveraging a small amount of effort to cause the legitimate OPC UA Application to spend a large amount of time responding, thus taking away processing resources from legitimate activities.\nGetEndpoints (specified in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4)) and OpenSecureChannel (specified in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4)) are the only services that the Server handles before the Client is authenticated. The response to GetEndpoints is only a set of static information so the Server does not need to do much processing. The response to OpenSecureChannel consumes significant Server resources because of the signature and encryption processing. OPC UA has minimized this processing, but it cannot be eliminated.\nThe Server implementation could protect itself from floods of OpenSecureChannel Messages in two ways.\nFirst, the Server could intentionally delay its processing of OpenSecureChannel requests once it receives more than some minimum number of bad OpenSecureChannel requests. It should also issue an alarm to alert plant personnel that an attack is underway that could be blocking new legitimate OpenSecureChannel calls.\nSecond, when an OpenSecureChannel request attempts to exceed the Server\u0027s specified maximum number of concurrent channels the Server replies with an error response without performing the signature and encryption processing. Certified OPC UA Servers are required to specify their maximum number of concurrent channels in their product documentation as specified in[OPC 10000-7](/\u00A7UAPart7).\nOPC UA user and Client Authentication reduce the risk of a legitimate Client being used to mount a flooding attack.

The Clients also ignore extra responses that could be received and closes the connection.\nIn PubSub, the Subscriber filters messages that it processes based on header information, allowing it to quickly discard any messages that do not conform to its required filter. In addition, the message signature is checked to eliminate any message that is well formed, but not from the desired SecurityGroup. PubSub can also be configured for unicast instead of multicast, which allows the network infrastructure to block multicast flooding attacks.\nOPC UA Auditing functionality provides the site with evidence that can help the site discover that flooding attacks are being mounted and find ways to prevent similar future attacks (see[4.14](/\u00A7_Ref138589474)). As a best practice, Audit Events should be monitored for excessive connection requests.\nOPC UA relies upon the site CSMS to prevent attacks such as Message flooding at protocol layers and systems that support OPC UA."

Error codes can be used as an attack vector; thus, their uses shall be limited as described in Part 4 Service Behaviours clause. Once the SecureChannel has been established then appropriate specific error codes are returned.\nAnother attack vector that can be used is timing variations; this is minimized by the description in Part 4 that requires the closing of the socket for any errors when establishing a SecureChannel. Vendors should be careful in their implementation to ensure that all paths that result in the closure of the socket do not provide a timing hint indicating which failure path was encountered.

      "Content": "Random numbers that meet security needs can be generated by suitable functions that are provided by cryptography libraries. Common random functions such as using rand() provided by the \u0022C\u0022 standard library do not generate enough entropy. As an alternative, implementers could use the random number generators provided by the Microsoft Windows Crypto library (WinCrypt library) or by OpenSSL. Even the random functions provided in cryptography libraries require a source of entropy to initialize and the required entropy is not always available on embedded devices. PCs can use several individual pieces of information (hardware ids like CPU, MAC addresses, USB devices, screen resolution, installed software, etc.) to generate entropy, but embedded devices are built completely identically. Often only the time and possibly a MAC address is left for entropy. These sources of entropy can be guessed or discovered. This makes the embedded devices very vulnerable.\nA common mistake is to generate cryptographic keys during the first boot. Thus even the time information is predictable (creation time is stored e.g. in a certificate). Some alternate solutions a vendor could want to consider:\nAdd specific entropy generator hardware when designing embedded devices.\nDo not generate certificates on embedded devices. Use an external tool or the GDS to generate the certificate and load it onto the device. A problem could still remain for the SymmetricKeys, as these are normally not created directly during the boot phase; rather they are created when a client connects.\nWait long enough until enough entropy information is available. Some operating systems provide hints when they have reached this point.\nFor embedded systems without a good entropy source, it is helpful to store the cryptographic pseudo-random number generator (CPRNG) state, so that it will not produce the same random numbers after every boot.\nVendor should ensure that cryptographic functions they use are initialized with suitable entropy and that the generated certificates are not created in a predictable manner."

OPC UA provides the tools required for this protection, but it is up to the implementer to ensure that they are exercised correctly. All functions that allow changes to the running environment are able to generate Audit Events and are to be restricted to appropriate users.\nThe disabling of Alarms is one such function that should be restricted to personnel with appropriate access rights. Furthermore, any action that disables an alarm, whether it be initiated by personnel or some automated system, should generate an Audit Event indicating the action.\nThe shelving of alarms should follow similar guideline as the disabling of alarms with regard to access and Auditing, although it is often available to a wider range of users (operators, engineers). Also, the implementer should ensure that appropriate timeouts are configured for Alarm Shelving. These timeouts should ensure that an Alarm cannot be shelved for a period of time that could cause safety concerns.\nDialog Events could also be used to overload a Client. It would be a best practice for Servers that support dialogs to restrict the number of concurrent dialogs that could be active. Also, Dialogs should include some timeout period to ensure that they are not used to create a DOS. Client implementers should also ensure that any dialog processing cannot be used to overwhelm an operator. The maximum number of open dialogs should be restricted and dialogs should be able to be ignored (i.e. other processing should still be available)."

Zero trust environments do not rely on perimeter defences. Many of the key concepts described in zero trust follow key concepts describe in this document. For a more complete overview of the core principles in zero trust see[ZeroTrustCore](/\u00A7ZeroTRucstPrin).\nOPC UA, with its built-in security capabilities, is a very good fit for a zero trust environment. The capability to assign permissions down to individual Nodes, the ability to provide both application level and user level authentication, and support for central management of Authorization and Authentication(GDS functionality), are all concepts desired in a zero-trust environment. Another key tenant of a zero trust architecture is the concept of least-privilege, which can easily be applied using OPC UA.\nSome key concepts related to a zero trust network is that the network is not trusted and that devices on the network are not trusted.\nA key point is that information that is flowing between the enterprise network and non-enterprise network needs to have consistent security policies. Furthermore, for a zero trust architecture additional safe guards should be in-place like diagnostics and monitoring systems, network logging, access policies, a PKI infrastructure and User identification systems. For additional details on the architecture of zero trust network see[ZeroTrustArchitecture](/\u00A7ZeroTRucstArch).\nOPC UA is designed to operate in a multi-vendor environment, where devices from many vendors (not all of which would be trusted) could be operating. The hardware and software on these devices could be owned by the enterprise or they could be owned by others. OPC UA is designed to assign trust as needed, not inheritably trusting any device.

The provisioning phase is when the GDS is providing initial certificate(s) to Clients or Servers that are just entering the system. The runtime phase is the day to day operation of the system and includes providing updated CRLs, certificate renewals and updated TrustLists.\nThe runtime phase of GDS certificate operations can be performed in a very secure manner, since all Servers and Clients already have certificates to ensure a secure connection. For the push model of certificate management, the GDS establishes a SecureChannel using the highest security level available in the target Server. It does not provide updated CRLs, Certificates or TrustLists via an endpoint that has a lower security level than the security level of the updates. For example, if a 4096 certificate is to be updated it cannot be updated using a 2048 channel, but a 2048 certificate can be updated using a 4096 channel. If a new higher-level certificate is deployed, it is handled in the same manner as the provisioning of a new Server(see SecurityLevel in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4))."

      "Content": "From an Installation point of view, it is a best practice that a standard tool to generate an ApplicationInstanceCertificate is provided. This tool could be one provided by an OPC UA SDK vendor or by the OPC Foundation. The standard tool ensures that the ApplicationInstanceCertificates that are generated include all of the required fields and settings. A particular OPC UA Application should be able to accept and install any valid ApplicationInstanceCertificates generated by external tools. The choice of the actual tool is site specific.[Figure 13](/\u00A7_Ref169050749) provides an overview of some of the key points of Certificate handling.\n[image016.png](images/image016.png) Figure 13- Certificate handling\nThe following is a summary of these key points when a CA based security system is deployed:\nApplicationInstance - An OPC UA Application installed on a single machine is called an ApplicationInstance. Each instance has its own ApplicationInstanceCertificate which it uses to identify itself when connecting to other OPC UA Applications(the Public Key and Private Key). Each ApplicationInstance has a globally unique URI which identifies it. The OPC UA Application will also check TrustLists and CRL\u0027s to determine if access should be granted. The OPC UA Application will communicate using a SecureChannel established using Asymmetric Cryptography with other applications.\nAdministrator - The person or persons that administer the Certificate handling associated with a UA system and manage the security settings for ApplicationInstances. This includes setting the contents of TrustLists and managing any activities performed by a CA.\nOperator ApplicationInstance. More than one Operator can exist for any given OPC UA Application. An Operator can have User Credentials which are used to determine access rights and to track activities within the ApplicationInstance.\nUser Credential - A User Credential is a generic term for an electronic ID which identifies an Operator/User. It can be passed to a Server"

      "Content": "Server after the ApplicationInstanceCertificate is used to create a SecureChannel. It can be used to determine access rights and to track activities (auditing).\nCertificate Authority (CA) - A Certificate Authority(CA) is an administrator or organization which is responsible for creating and managing Certificates(it is usually a partially automated software product). The Certificate Authority verifies that Claims placed in the ApplicationInstanceCertificate is correct and adds a Digital Signature to the Certificate that is used to verify that the information has not been changed. Each CA has its own Certificate which is used to create the Digital Signatures. A CA is also responsible for maintaining CRLs. In most cases it is a software package that an administrator periodically reviews or accesses, usually when the software package generates an alarm or notification that some review action is required.\nCertificate - A Certificate is an electronic ID that can be held by an OPC UA Application. The ID includes information ( Claims) that identifies the holder, the issuer, and a unique key that is used to verify Digital Signatures created with the associated Private Key. The syntax of these Certificates conforms to the X.509 specification and as a result these Certificates are also called \u0022 X.509 Certificates\u0022.\nSelf-Signed Certificate - A self-signed Certificate is a Certificate which has no Certificate Authority. These Certificates can be created by anyone and can be used in situations where the administrators of OPC UA Applications are able to verify the Claims by reviewing the contents themselves. A system that uses only self-signed Certificates would not have CA or CRL.\nPrivate Key - A Private Key is a secret number known only to the holder of a Certificate. This secret allows the holder to create Digital Signatures and decrypt data. If this secret is revealed to unauthorized parties then the associated Certificate can no longer be trusted or used. It is replaced or in the case of a CA generated"

      "Content": "Certificate it is revoked.\nTrustList - When security is enabled, OPC UA Applications reject connections from peers whose Certificates are not in the trusted list or if the Certificate is issued by a CA that is not in the TrustList.\nCertificate Store - A Certificate Store is a place where Certificates and Private Keys can be stored on a file system. All Windows systems provide a registry-based store called the Windows Certificate Store. All UA systems can also support a directory containing the Certificates stored in a file which is also called an OpenSSL Certificate Store. In all cases the Certificate Store is secured, such that only administrators are allowed to write new entries. The security settings should follow the \u0027least privileged\u0027 principle, in that read or write access is only allowed to those who really need the data. This means that an administrator for example can store Private Keys but is not allowed to read them, and conversely an UA application can read such Private Keys but cannot write them.\nRevocation List - A Revocation List is a list of Certificates which have been revoked by a CA and are not accepted by an ApplicationInstance."

      "Content": "RSA provides security using the mathematical concept that it is much more difficult to factor a number than to multiply two large numbers together. RSA uses two keys - a public key and a private key. RSA can be used for digital signatures and for encryption of data. The digital signature is generated using the private key and the public key can be used to validate that it was generated using the private key. For encryption, the data is encrypted using the public key and it can only be decrypted using the private key. There are a number of different algorithms that provide for signatures and encryption using these concepts.\nAsymmetric encryption (using the two keys) can be very computationally intensive, can result in large keys and is rather slow, but it is well understood and publicly available. Typically, it is only used to exchange a SymmetricKey which is then used for all communication (signing and encryption)."

It depends on being able to compute a point (multiplication) and the difficulty in computing the multiplicand given the original point and the resulting product. The size of the elliptical curve determines how difficult the problem is. For ECC the parameters that define the curve must be known by all. There are a number of well-known curves that can be used."

      "Content": "Figure B. 1 - Elliptical Curve Example\nCompared to RSA, ECC requires smaller integers and thus much less computational power and has a smaller key to transmit. ECC is only used for signing not encryption, but it does allow for the generation of a shared secret over an un-secured channel (ECDH). Once the shared secrete is generated then Symmetric encryption can be used. ECC is not as well-known as RSA and there are many different curves, some of which are restricted by patents. The patents can apply to the algorithm that are used and / or the technique used. For interoperability it is important that a selected curve is supported by multiple libraries/platforms.\n\nBibliography\nO-PAS\u2122 Standard, Version 2.1, Copyright \u00A9 2021 The Open Group\n___________"
