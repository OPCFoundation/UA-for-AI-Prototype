      "Content": "OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a platform-independent standard designed to facilitate seamless information exchange in industrial automation and other domains. It provides a comprehensive framework for modelling information, secure communication, and ensuring interoperability between diverse systems and devices.\nThis part of OPC 10000 introduces the fundamental concepts and provides a high-level overview of the OPC Unified Architecture. It covers key architectural principles, fundamental models such as the AddressSpace Model and the Security Model, and the roles of core OPC UA components like Clients and Servers. It is intended for developers, system integrators, and anyone needing a high-level understanding of OPC UA. This part of the specification focuses on providing a conceptual foundation and does not delve into detailed implementation specifics or protocol mappings, which are covered in other parts of the OPC 10000 series.\nThis part provides the foundational knowledge necessary to understand the subsequent parts of the OPC 10000 series, which delve into specific aspects of the architecture, such as security (Part 2), the AddressSpace model (Part 3), and Services (Part 4). Each of the other parts is briefly explained along with a suggested reading order."

It employs mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and integrity checks to ensure the identity of OPC UA Applications as well as identification of users and protect against attacks.\nUsing the ClientServer model, OPC UA defines sets of Services that Servers provide, and it utilizes both OPC UA-defined and vendor-defined data types, along with flexible object models, to facilitate interoperability and dynamic information discovery by Clients. Supporting a variety of communication protocols and data encodings, such as TCP, HTTPS, WebSockets, XML/text, UA Binary, and JSON, OPC UA allows for trade-offs between portability and efficiency to suit different application requirements. Servers can provide access to both current and historical data, as well as Alarms and Events to notify Clients of important changes.\nIn addition to the ClientServer model, OPC UA also supports information transfer from Publishers to Subscribers using the PubSub model."

      "Content": "OPC UA provides a consistent, integrated AddressSpace and service model. This allows a single Server to integrate data, Alarms and Events, and history into its AddressSpace, and to provide access to them using an integrated set of Services. These Services also include an integrated security model.\nOPC UA also allows Servers to provide Clients with type definitions for the Objects accessed from the AddressSpace. This allows Information Models to be used to describe the contents of the AddressSpace. OPC UA allows data to be exposed in many different formats, including binary structures and XML or JSON documents. The format of the data may be defined by OPC, other standard organizations or vendors. Through the AddressSpace, Clients can query the Server for the metadata that describes the format for the data. In many cases, Clients with no pre-programmed knowledge of the data formats will be able to determine the formats at runtime and properly utilize the data.\nOPC UA adds support for many relationships between Nodes instead of being limited to just a single hierarchy. In this way, a Server may present data in a variety of hierarchies tailored to the way a set of Clients would typically like to view the data. This flexibility, combined with support for type definitions, makes OPC UA applicable to a wide array of problem domains. As illustrated in[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref402707464), OPC UA is not targeted at just the SCADA, PLC and DCS interface, but also as a way to provide greater interoperability between higher level functions."

Under \u0022Corporate Enterprise,\u0022 we can see elements such as \u0022OPC UA Broker,\u0022 which is a software component that enables the interoperability of devices and applications using the OPC UA standard, and \u0022HMI (Human-Machine Interface),\u0022 which is an interface for operators to control and monitor the industrial processes. 3. The \u0022Manufacturing \u0026 Production\u0022 area shows \u0022OPC UA Server,\u0022 which is a server that provides data and services to the OPC UA clients, and \u0022DCS (Distributed Control System).\u0022 A DCS typically controls and monitors multiple process units in an industrial plant. 4. Between these two areas, there\u0027s a flow of data or signals indicated by arrows labeled \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 suggesting that data is being exchanged between the corporate enterprise and the manufacturing \u0026 production areas. 5. Below the corporate enterprise, we see \u0022PLC (Programmable Logic Controller),\u0022 which is used to control industrial processes like factory machinery and equipment. 6. The bottom part of the diagram includes various components such as \u0022OPC UA Server,\u0022 \u0022Control,\u0022 and \u0022Batch,\u0022 indicating different aspects of industrial operations, possibly referencing the control logic for automating processes in batches. 7.

      "Content": "Figure 1 - OPC UA target applications\nOPC UA is designed to provide robustness of published data. A major feature of all OPC servers is the ability to publish data and Event Notifications. OPC UA provides mechanisms for Clients to quickly detect and recover from communication failures associated with these transfers without having to wait for long timeouts provided by the underlying protocols.\nOPC UA is designed to support a wide range of Servers, from plant floor PLCs to enterprise Servers. These Servers are characterized by a broad scope of size, performance, execution platforms and functional capabilities. Therefore, OPC UA defines a comprehensive set of capabilities, and Servers may implement a subset of these capabilities. To promote interoperability, OPC UA defines subsets, referred to as Profiles, to which Servers may claim conformance. Clients can then discover the Profiles of a Server, and tailor their interactions with that Server based on the Profiles. Profiles are defined in[OPC 10000-7](/\u00A7UAPart7).\nThe OPC UA is layered to isolate the core design from the underlying computing technology and network transport. This allows OPC UA to be mapped to future technologies as necessary, without negating the basic design. Mappings and data encodings are described in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6). Several data encodings are defined:\nXML/text,\nUA Binary,\nJSON.\nIn addition, several protocols are defined:\nOPC UA TCP,\nHTTPS,\nWebSockets.\nOPC UA Applications that support multiple transports and encodings will allow the end users to make decisions about trade-offs between performance and compatibility at the time of deployment, rather than having these trade-offs determined by the OPC vendor at the time of product definition."

      "Content": "OPC UA is designed as the migration path for OPC clients and servers that are based on Microsoft COM technology (OPC Classic). Care has been taken in the design of OPC UA so that existing data exposed by OPC COM servers (DA, HDA and A\u0026E) can easily be mapped and exposed via OPC UA. Vendors may choose migrating their products natively to OPC UA or use external wrappers to convert from OPC COM to OPC UA and vice-versa. Each of the specifications of OPC Classic developed by OPC Foundation defined its own address space model and its own set of Services. OPC UA unifies the previous models into a single integrated address space with a single set of Services.\nOPC UA PubSub opens new application fields for OPC UA. The following are some example uses for PubSub:\nConfigurable peer to peer communication between controllers and between controllers and HMIs. The peers are not directly connected and do not even need to know about the existence of each other. The data exchange often requires a fixed time-window; it may be point-to-point or a multi-point connection.\nAsynchronous workflows. For example, an order processing application can place an order on a message queue or an enterprise service bus. From there it can be processed by one or more workers.\nLogging to multiple systems; for example, sensors or actuators can write logs to a monitoring system, an HMI, an archive application for later querying, and so on.\nServers representing services or devices can stream data to applications hosted in the cloud. For example, backend servers, big data analytics for system optimization and predictive maintenance.\nPubSub is not bound to a particular messaging system. Rather it can be mapped to various different systems as illustrated with two examples:\nPubSub"

It shows a flowchart with various components and their interactions, as well as a box labeled \u0022OPC UA Client\u0022 at the top right corner. Here are the visible elements in the diagram: 1. **OPC UA Client**: This is likely the primary focus of the figure, representing the software that uses the OPC UA standard to communicate with servers or other devices on a network. 2. **OPC UA Server**: Indicated by dashed lines connected to the client, suggesting that it sends information to and receives information from the server. 3. **Communication**: The arrows between the client and the server represent the exchange of data over a network using the OPC UA protocol. 4. **OPC UA Client UI (User Interface)**: This component is responsible for the user\u0027s interaction with the OPC UA client application, allowing them to perform various tasks such as configuring the connection, browsing the OPC UA server\u0027s namespace, and handling data transfer. 5. **OPC UA Client Axis (Axis)**: The horizontal axis at the bottom of the diagram represents different aspects or features of the client application, although their exact meaning is not clear from the image alone. 6. **OPC UA Server Endpoint**: This is where the OPC UA server makes itself available for communication with clients using a specific endpoint URL. 7. **OPC UA Client Discovery Service**: The service seems to be responsible for discovering and configuring the connection to the OPC UA server. It\u0027s likely used for finding available servers on the network and establishing connections to them."

The diagram includes several components and their relationships, which are fundamental to understanding how OPC UA works. Here\u0027s a breakdown of the elements in the diagram: 1. **OPC UA Server**: This is the central element that is hosting and managing the system. It provides the interface for communication between the user and the devices or systems being monitored. 2. **Clients**: These are applications or systems that connect to the OPC UA server to interact with the connected devices. There can be multiple clients, each with a unique identifier (NodeID), which allows them to communicate independently with the server. 3. **OPC UA Endpoint**: Each client connects to an endpoint, represented by a circle with dashed lines around it. This is where the communication between the server and the client takes place. 4. **OPC UA Namespace**: This represents the logical structure of the data that is being shared between the clients and the server. It allows for organization and separation of different groups of data within the system. 5. **OPC UA Objects**: These are the individual pieces of information or data points that are being monitored or controlled. They are organized hierarchically within the namespace, with properties (like values or status) associated with each object. 6. **Server Application, Address Space, and Objects**: This is where the server application is running, which serves as the host for the OPC UA server. It has an address space that contains objects relevant to the server\u0027s operation, and these objects are further categorized into groups based on their function or purpose. 7. **Data Flow Arrows**: These arrows indicate the flow of data from the server to the clients and vice versa. They represent how information is exchanged between the two entities."

The Client and Server responsibilities when using either transparent or non-transparent redundancy are defined in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4).\nServers that support non-transparent redundancy can also support client-controlled load balancing. The health of a Server including its ability to Service requests is collectively defined as ServiceLevel. See[OPC 10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) for a formal definition of ServiceLevel.[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4) defines four distinct ServiceLevel sub-ranges and example usage."

      "Content": "The Publish-Subscribe ( PubSub) communication model in OPC UA offers an alternative to the ClientServer model, enabling efficient and/or decoupled communication. With PubSub, OPC UA Applications do not directly exchange requests and responses. Instead, Publishers send messages to a Message Oriented Middleware, without knowledge of what, if any, Subscribers there may be. Similarly, Subscribers express interest in specific types of data, and process messages that contain this data, without knowledge of what Publishers there are.\nMessage Oriented Middleware is software or hardware infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed systems. It depends on the Message Oriented Middleware how this distribution is implemented.\nTo cover a large number of use cases, OPC UA PubSub supports two largely different Message Oriented Middleware variants. These are:\nA broker-less form, where the Message Oriented Middleware is the network infrastructure that is able to route datagram-based messages. Subscribers and Publishers use datagram protocols like UDP multicast.\nA broker-based form, where the Message Oriented Middleware is a Broker. Subscribers and Publishers use standard messaging protocols like AMQP or MQTT to communicate with the Broker. All messages are published to specific queues (e.g. topics, nodes) that the Broker exposes and Subscribers can listen to these queues. The Broker may translate messages from the formal messaging protocol of the Publisher to the formal messaging protocol of the Subscriber.\nPubSub is used to communicate messages between different system components without these components having to know each other\u0027s identity.\nA Publisher is pre-configured with what data to send. There is no connection establishment between Publisher and Subscriber.\nThe knowledge about who Subscribers are and the forwarding of published data to the Subscribers is off-loaded to the Message Oriented Middleware. The Publisher does not know or even care if there is one or many"

      "Content": "OPC UA PubSub and ClientServer models are complementary and can be combined and used synergistically. The OPC UA Information Model is the foundation for both. A typical scenario involves using ClientServer interactions for configuration, control, and on-demand data access, while PubSub is used for efficient, high-speed dissemination of real-time data. For instance, a Client application might use ClientServer to configure a Server and set up PubSub connections. Subsequently, the Server/Publisher publishes real-time data updates using PubSub, and the Client/Subscriber subscribes to this data stream for continuous monitoring.\nOPC PubSub can easily be integrated into Servers and Clients. Quite typically, a Publisher will be a Server(the owner of information) and a Subscriber is often a Client. Above all, the PubSub Information Model for configuration promotes the configuration of Publishers and Subscribers using the OPC UA ClientServer model.\n[Figure 7](/\u00A7_Ref471458833) depicts a single OPC UA Application that acts as both a Server and a Publisher."

      "Content": "OPC Unified Architecture is highly decentralized and is mostly concerned with the standardization of the independent interactions between UA Applications(i.e. between Clients and Servers and between Publishers and Subscribers). However, as the number of Applications in a given system grows, there are advantages to having some information centralized and interactions that are uniform among all Applications in a system. For example, if a system consists of one Server and one or more Clients, it is reasonable for the Server to be configured with the usernames and passwords of all users that can access the Server. If instead a system has hundreds of Servers, then it becomes unmanageable for each Server to independently store and maintain the usernames and passwords for all users of the system. For scenarios like this, the Unified Architecture includes certain centralized, global components to provide consistency and alleviate administration burden.\nIdeally all Applications should work with all the defined global services when they are present in a system, but Applications that wish to utilize a particular global service need to be designed and built to do so. Keep in mind that the use of the global services in a system is always optional, so Applications should not be written to require their presence."

Discovery is provided through the browse Services. Clients discover the Methods supported by a Server by browsing for the owning Objects that identify their supported Methods.\nBecause Methods may control some aspect of plant operations, method invocation may depend on environmental or other conditions. This may be especially true when attempting to re-invoke a Method immediately after it has completed execution. Conditions that are required to invoke the Method may not yet have returned to the state that permits the Method to start again. In addition, some Methods may be capable of supporting concurrent invocations, while others may have a single invocation executing at a given time."

      "Content": "The MonitoredItem Service Set is used by the Client to create and maintain MonitoredItems. MonitoredItems monitor Variables, Attributes and EventNotifiers. They generate Notifications when they detect certain conditions. They monitor Variables for a change in value or status; Attributes for a change in value; and EventNotifiers for newly generated Alarm and Event reports.\nEach MonitoredItem identifies the item to monitor and the Subscription to use to periodically publish Notifications to the Client(see[6.10](/\u00A7_Ref106091688)). Each MonitoredItem also specifies the rate at which the item is to be monitored (sampled) and, for Variables and EventNotifiers, the filter criteria used to determine when a Notification is to be generated. Filter criteria for Attributes are specified by their Attribute definitions in[OPC 10000-4](/\u00A7UAPart4).\nThe sample rate defined for a MonitoredItem may be faster than the publishing rate of the Subscription. For this reason, the MonitoredItem may be configured to either queue all Notifications or to queue only the latest Notification for transfer by the Subscription. In this latter case, the queue size is one.\nMonitoredItem Services also define a monitoring mode. The monitoring mode is configured to disable sampling and reporting, to enable sampling only, or to enable both sampling and reporting. When sampling is enabled, the Server samples the item. In addition, each sample is evaluated to determine if a Notification should be generated. If so, the Notification is queued. If reporting is enabled, the queue is made available to the Subscription for transfer.\nFinally, MonitoredItems can be configured to trigger the reporting of other MonitoredItems. In this case, the monitoring mode of the items to report is typically set to sampling only, and when the triggering item generates a Notification, any queued Notifications"

      "Content": "The Subscription Service Set is used by the Client to create and maintain Subscriptions. Subscriptions are entities that periodically publish NotificationMessages for the MonitoredItem assigned to them (see[6.9](/\u00A7_Ref134708132)). The NotificationMessage contains a common header followed by a series of Notifications. The format of Notifications is specific to the type of item being monitored (i.e. Variables, Attributes, and EventNotifiers).\nOnce created, the existence of a Subscription is independent of the Client\u0027s Session with the Server. This allows one Client to create a Subscription, and a second, possibly a redundant Client, to receive NotificationMessages from it.\nTo protect against non-use by Clients, Subscriptions have a configured lifetime that Clients periodically renew. If any Client fails to renew the lifetime, the lifetime expires and the Subscription is closed by the Server. When a Subscription is closed, all MonitoredItems assigned to the Subscription are deleted.\nSubscriptions include features that support detection and recovery of lost Messages. Each NotificationMessage contains a sequence number that allows Clients to detect missed Messages. When there are no Notifications to send within the keep-alive time interval, the Server sends a keep-alive Message that contains the sequence number of the next NotificationMessage sent. If a Client fails to receive a Message after the keep-alive interval has expired, or if it determines that it has missed a Message, it can request the Server to resend one or more Messages.\n\n\nBibliography\nIEC 61508 (all parts), Functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems\n[https://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/standards/](https://www.iec.ch/functionalsafety/standards/)"
