The diagram uses a combination of rectangles and arrows to illustrate the steps involved in device lifecycle management from creation to decommissioning, with a focus on device onboarding. At the top left, there is a rectangle labeled \u0022Manufacturer\u0022 connected to another rectangle labeled \u0022Distribution,\u0022 indicating the first step in the lifecycle which is the manufacturing of the device. From distribution, a product flows to \u0022Deployment\u0022 where it is integrated into the target environment. After deployment, the device enters the operational phase as part of the \u0022Device Onboarding\u0022 process. The onboarding process involves several activities such as configuration, integration, and commissioning. Once the device has been set up and is in operation, it becomes part of the \u0022Distribution\u0022 network, which could be an internal IT system or a specific protocol like OPC (OLE for Process Control) and OPC UA (Unified Automation), signifying that the device can communicate with other systems. The diagram includes additional text and labels such as \u0022Component manufacturer,\u0022 \u0022Distributor,\u0022 \u0022Decommissioning,\u0022 and \u0022Operator.\u0022 The arrows indicate the flow of a device through these stages: from the manufacturer, to distribution, deployment, onboarding, operation, and finally decommissioning. The image is designed in a way that suggests a structured approach to managing devices throughout their lifespan within an organization, including the critical step of integrating new devices into the system and ensuring they are properly configured and tested before being put into service."

The slide is organized into four layers: Device Configuration, Security Configuration, Application Configure, and User Applications. Each layer is represented as a separate horizontal block, with arrows pointing downward from left to right to indicate the flow or hierarchy of these components. 1. **Device Configuration**: This layer includes components such as DAC (Data Acquisition Server), DAS (Data Acquisition System), and DAQ (Data Acquisition Software). There are also mentions of configuration files like \u0022DAC.cfg\u0022 and device-specific configurations. 2. **Security Configuration**: The security configuration layer is represented with elements like SSL/TLS, User Authentication, Access Control, and Encryption. It also mentions the use of digital certificates for secure communication between devices. 3. **Application Configure**: This layer contains references to device configurations such as DAC.cfg and OPC. The \u0022OPC\u0022 acronym is likely referring to the OPC standard mentioned in the caption, which stands for Open Platform Communications. It\u0027s a framework of software standards for secure and reliable communication between computers and industrial automation devices. 4. **User Applications**: This layer consists of various software applications that interface with the devices or systems at the lower layers. Examples given are \u0022OPC UI,\u0022 \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 and \u0022OPC Connect.\u0022 These applications typically use OPC protocols to communicate with the devices and display real-time data, control settings, etc., in a user-friendly manner. 5. **Data Acquisition Server (DAS)**: This is mentioned as part of the Device Configuration layer, but it\u0027s also related to the User Applications layer because it provides data acquisition services."

It features a central process labeled \u0022Transfer of Physical Control\u0022 and is accompanied by descriptions of different aspects that might be involved in such a process. Here\u0027s a breakdown of the visible elements: 1. The central process is connected to three components:- \u0022Composite Builder\u0022 at the top left- \u0022Distributor\u0022 in the middle- \u0022Integrator\u0022 on the right side 2. From the Composite Builder, there are two paths indicated by arrows pointing to the Distributor and Integrator, suggesting that it is the starting point for control transfer. 3. The Distributor connects to both the OPC and OPC UA standards, which are industrial interoperability standards used for real-time communication in automation systems. 4. There\u0027s a dashed line connecting from the Integrator back to the Composite Builder, indicating a feedback loop or a closed system where control can be returned. 5. The text boxes contain terms like \u0022Manufacturer,\u0022 \u0022Distributor,\u0022 and \u0022Owner/operator.\u0022 These likely represent different parties involved in the process of physical control transfer, such as the entity that manufactures the device (the manufacturer), the intermediary through which the control is distributed (the distributor), and the end-user who operates or controls the device (the owner/operator). 6. The diagram does not contain any direct representation of charts or data but seems to be a conceptual model rather than an actual chart or graph. The overall theme suggests that the figure is part of a technical discussion or guide on how physical control in a device can be transferred through various intermediaries and standards, such as OPC (OLE for Process Control) and OPC UA (Unified Automation)."

      "Content": "Figure 3 - Possible Transfers of Physical Control\nIn many cases, the Distributor belongs to the same organization as the Manufacturer or CompositeBuilder. Similarly, the Integrator and the OwnerOperator may be the same organization.\nWhen a transfer of physical control occurs, the supplier ships the equipment (a Device or Composite) and an electronic Ticket(see[6](/\u00A7_Ref25765793)) that describes the equipment. The receiver may use the Ticket to authenticate the origin of the equipment using the mechanisms defined in this standard or save it so it can be provided when the equipment is transferred to another actor.\nWhile an actor has physical control, the actor may Install, Provision, Configure or Operate(see[Table 2](/\u00A7_Ref17505968)) the equipment. For example, if an actor (e.g., a CompositeBuilder) makes changes to a Device and then transfers this Device to another actor (e.g., an OwnerOperator) then those changes may restrict what the new owner is able to do, i.e., CompositeBuilder may install an Application used for maintenance that the OwnerOperator cannot access.\nThe workflows (see[4.3](/\u00A7_Ref94586426)) describe this process in more detail."

      "Content": "The onboarding process defined in this document describes how an OwnerOperator can authenticate Devices added to the network. This document does not define any mechanisms to allow Devices to authenticate the network it is connected to. This implies that a Device connected to a network will allow itself to be configured via any network that it is connected to. This behaviour is called \u0022Trust on First Use\u0022 or TOFU.\nWhen first connected to a network the DCA will be in an initial state where it will either attempt to discover a network service that it can get its configuration ( PullManagement, see[7.2](/\u00A7_Ref99376121)) or wait for another application to provide its configuration ( PushManagement, see[7.3](/\u00A7_Ref99376253)).\nOnce the onboarding process completes the DCA is supplied with credentials that authorize Applications that are allowed to make changes to its security configuration. Devices should have a mechanism to return the DCA to an initial state which discards all configuration, including all credentials and TrustLists that were assigned in a previous onboarding process.\nThe new state allows the TOFU onboarding process to start again. Note the initial state is not the same as a factory reset which typically deletes all software installed on the Device. The reset mechanism should require proof of physical possession of the Device to ensure it cannot be exploited remotely.\nThe TOFU model exposes the Device to malicious actors that are running on the network. This means the network used for configuration has to be protected to make it harder for a malicious actor to gain access to the network. OwnerOperators should also have network services designed to detect and eliminate malicious applications that attempt to interfere with the onboarding process.\nDevices may have other ways to assign the credentials provided by the onboarding process in order to avoid the risks associated with TOFU."

How this information is transmitted is out of scope but it could be email, a block chain ledger, cloud based webservice, a file on a USB stick or some other mechanism. This specification defines the format of a document that contains information that needs to be provided with a Device. A Ticket is the term used for a document that describes one or more Devices and has a Digital Signature that can be used to verify that the contents of the document have not been altered and that they confirm the origin of the Device.\nTickets are long lived documents which means the signing Certificate should be issued by a widely trusted root Certificate Authority that is likely to be in business even if the Manufacturer or CompositeBuilder has gone out of business. Tickets allow additional Signatures to be added at any time by an entity in the chain of physical control. The current owner of a Device validates the Ticket by choosing a Signature created by an authority it trusts.\nFor example, a CompositeBuilder re-signs the Tickets for the Devices to associate the CompositeInstanceUri with the Device Ticket(see[8.1](/\u00A7_Ref51594798)). Customers of the CompositeBuilder will not need a relationship with the Manufacturer of the Device to validate the Ticket.\nDeviceIdentity Certificates are typically signed with a chain ending in a root CA owned by the Manufacturer or CompositeBuilder.

This could be done automatically if the Registrar is integrated with the ERP. It can also be a manual process where a digital file is delivered to an RegistrarAdmin that uploads it to Registrar. When a new Device is detected on the network the matching Ticket is found which confirms that the Device is authorized.\nThe second strategy uses a Ticket that is distributed with the Device or Composite. This Ticket could be stored on the Device or on physical media that was delivered with the Device. When a Device is connected to the network the Ticket is either manually uploaded to the Registrar by the technician installing the Device or is read from the Device during the authentication process. For this strategy to be secure the Certificates used to sign the Tickets are provided to the Registrar in advance by the RegistrarAdmin. A Device is authorized to be on the network if the Ticket is valid, it matches the Device and is signed by a trusted Ticket authority.\nThe steps to validate a Ticket are as follows:\nVerify that a signing Certificate is valid and trusted;\nVerify the Signature is valid;\n\nTickets that are not valid shall not be used.\nTickets may have multiple signatures added by different actors in the supply chain.

This Certificate is called the DCA Certificate.\nWhen using PullManagement([7.2](/\u00A7_Ref99376121)) the DCA connects to the Registrar without security and calls the ProvideIdentities Method.

The acronym \u0022OPC UA\u0022 stands for Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture, which is a communication framework used in industrial automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide secure and reliable interoperability between different devices and systems. The chart shows several objects labeled with their names, such as \u0022Devices,\u0022 \u0022Server,\u0022 \u0022User,\u0022 \u0022Onboarding Workflow,\u0022 \u0022OPC UA Registration Type,\u0022 and \u0022OPC UA Address Space.\u0022 These labels suggest that the chart is outlining how devices are registered within an OPC UA address space during the onboarding process. The arrows in the chart indicate the flow of information or actions between different components, such as a device registering with a server, and a user providing their credentials for authorization. The numbers next to the arrows might represent specific steps or stages in the workflow. On the left side of the image, there is a \u0022Device\u0022 labeled with two types: OPC UA Device and Address Space. This could be indicating that devices are categorized based on their ability to communicate using OPC UA protocols and their associated address space within the network. The \u0022User\u0022 section shows three objects: User Registration, Authorization Type, and Credentials. This suggests a process where users must register, select an authorization type, and provide credentials to access the device or system. The \u0022OPC UA Registration Type\u0022 is connected to the devices and includes two types of registration: OPC UA Registration Type and OPC UA Address Space. This implies that there are different methods or types for registering a device within the OPC UA framework, including specifying an address space."

At the top of the diagram, there\u0027s a title that says \u0022OPC and OPC UA,\u0022 which refers to the Open Platform Communications unified architecture, a set of standards for industrial automation. The chart is divided into several sections with titles such as \u0022QS Server,\u0022 \u0022Resources,\u0022 \u0022Device,\u0022 and \u0022Application.\u0022 Each section contains sub-titles or steps that detail the process. For instance, under \u0022Device Address Space,\u0022 we see \u0022Application 2,\u0022 \u0022Configuration,\u0022 and \u0022Certificates.\u0022 The flowchart also includes boxes with various acronyms like \u0022QS Server,\u0022 \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 \u0022OPC,\u0022 and \u0022OPC Foundation.\u0022 These abbreviations likely refer to specific software, systems, or organizations related to the OPC standard.
