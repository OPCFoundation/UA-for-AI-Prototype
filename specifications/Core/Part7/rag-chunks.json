      "Content": "This document specifies value and structure of Profiles in the OPC Unified Architecture.\nThe actual Profiles are maintained in an online database and accessible via[https://profiles.opcfoundation.org/](https://profiles.opcfoundation.org/).\nOPC UA Profiles are used to segregate features with regard to testing of OPC UA products and the nature of the testing (tool based or lab based). This includes the testing performed by the OPC Foundation provided OPC UA CTT (a self-test tool) and by the OPC Foundation provided independent certification test labs. This could equally as well refer to test tools provided by another organization or a test lab provided by another organization. What is important is the concept of automated tool based testing versus lab based testing. The scope of this standard includes defining functionality that can only be tested in a lab and defining the grouping of functionality that is to be used when testing OPC UA products either in a lab or using automated tools. The definition of actual TestCases is not within the scope of this document, but the general categories of TestCases are within the scope of this document.\nMost OPC UA applications will conform to several, but not all of the Profiles."

These Services and information models can be referred to as features of a Server or Client. Servers and Clients need to be able to describe which features they support and wish to have certified. This document provides a grouping of these features. The individual features are grouped into ConformanceUnits which are further grouped into Profiles.[Figure 1](/\u00A7_Ref202340467) provides an overview of the interactions between Profiles, ConformanceUnits and TestCases. The large arrows indicate the components that are used to construct the parent. For example a Profile is constructed from Profiles and ConformanceUnits. The figure also illustrates a feature of the OPC UA Compliance Test Tool (CTT), in that it will test if a requested Profile passes all ConformanceUnits. It will also test all other ConformanceUnits and report any other Profiles that pass conformance testing. The individual TestCases are defined in separate documents see[Compliance Part 8 UA Server](/\u00A7CompliancePart8) and[Compliance Part 9 UA Client](/\u00A7CompliancePart9). The TestCases are related back to the appropriate ConformanceUnits defined in this standard. This relationship is also displayed by the OPC UA Compliance Test Tool."

From this list the vendor shall select the Profiles that include the functionality required by the application. Conformance to a single Profile may not yield a complete application. In most cases multiple Profiles are needed to yield a useful application. All UA applications shall support at least one Application Profile.\nFor example an HMI Client application may choose to support the Minimum UA Client 2022 Profile, the \u0022Data Access Client Facet\u0022, the \u0022DataChange Subscriber Client Facet\u0022 and the \u0022Attribute Write Client Facet\u0022. This list of Profiles would allow the Client to communicate with an OPC UA Server using UA-TCP/UA Security/UA Binary. It would be able to subscribe for data, write to data and would support the DA data model.\nClients should take into account the types of Servers and Server Profiles that they are targeted to support. Some Servers might not support Subscriptions and Clients should be able to fall back to the Read Service.\nA special case is a generic Client that is designed to communicate with a large number of Servers and therefore able to perform a broad range of functionality. \u0022Standard UA Client Profile\u0022 has been defined for this kind of Clients.\nMany Clients, however, will be specialized and do not need all of the functionality in the \u0022Standard UA Client Profile\u0022 and thus would only support the limited set of functionality they require. A trend Client, for example, would only need functionality to subscribe to or read data.\n____________"
