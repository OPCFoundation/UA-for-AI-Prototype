The effect is a by product of a Program state transition that can be used by a Client to monitor the progress of the Program. Effects can be internal or external. An external effect of a state transition is the generation of an Event notification. Each Program state transition is associated with a unique Event. These Events reflect the progression and trajectory of the Program through its set of defined states. The internal effects of a state transition can be the performance of some programmatic action such as the generation of data."

Additionally, the DomainDownloadType extends the ProgramStateMachineType by defining subordinate State Machines for the Program\u0027s Running and Halted states. The subordinate states describe the download operations in greater detail and allow the Client to monitor the activity of the download at a finer resolution.\nAn instance ( Program Invocation) of a DomainDownload Program is created by the Client each time a download is to be performed. The instance exists until explicitly removed by the Client. The initial state of the Program is Ready and the terminal state is Halted. The DomainDownload can be temporarily suspended and then resumed or aborted. Once halted, the program may not be restarted."

These states have been assigned unique transition identifier numbers that distinguish them from the base Program transition identifiers.
