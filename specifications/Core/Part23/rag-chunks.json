For example, a fan in a PC needs the power supply in order to work and the power supply needs the cooling from the fan, that it is not overheating. An example of a non-looping usage is that a robot utilizes a vision system in order to get the position where to grab something."

Both Nodes might represent different aspects of the same entity in the same world, or model the same aspect in different ways, for example defined in different companion specifications. For example, an ethernet port of a network module might be represented as an Object of an ObjectType defined by one companion specification focusing on the PROFINET relevant information for such a port and by another Object providing a more generic Ethernet and IP focused view on the port defined by an ObjectType in another companion specification. Both Objects may have distinguished information, but also provide some common information like the IP address, potentially in different data formats.\nIf a Server exposes more than two Nodes representing the same entity, it is recommended that all of the Nodes reference each other. A Client should not rely on all Nodes being mutually referenced to each other; i.e., the Client should browse each of the Nodes checking for additional RepresentsSameEntityAs References."

      "Content": "OPC UA relates Nodes using References. This concept is intentionally a simple construct, where the only information of a Reference is the SourceNode, the TargetNode, the ReferenceType and for asymmetric ReferenceTypes the direction (forward or inverse).\nSometimes, it is desirable to add more information to such a Reference. The concept of a ReferenceDescription keeps the simple Reference unchanged, and creates a Variable which is used to add more information about the Reference. Such a Variable can be referenced from the SourceNode and / or the TargetNode of such a Reference. Potentially, it can also be referenced by other Nodes to provide additional information (see also[5.2](/\u00A7_Ref63920887)). As Nodes can have several References, each ReferenceDescription Variable contains the unique definition of one Reference. An example is given in[Figure 2](/\u00A7_Ref63861017). ObjectA references ObjectB and ObjectC, each using the ReferenceType SomeReferenceType. Both References are described by a ReferenceDescription, that is, the Variables SomeReferenceType1 and SomeReferenceType2. The Values of those Variables uniquely identify the References by providing SourceNode, TargetNode, ReferenceType and direction. In the example, both ReferenceDescriptions have a Property with additional information, one called AdditionalInformationABC and the other AdditionalInformationXYZ."

The approach often makes sense. For example, to provide information about the physical cable connecting two devices represented as Nodes, another Node is added representing the cable, and both device Nodes are connected to the cable Node. The disadvantage of the approach is, that a Client cannot natively follow the Reference to the target directly, but always gets to the intermediate Object first and from there to the original target.  Therefore, the ReferenceDescription uses an approach, where the Reference directly connects both Nodes without the need to deal with an intermediate Object."
