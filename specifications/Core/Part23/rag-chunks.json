      "Content": "OPC UA relates Nodes using References. This concept is intentionally a simple construct, where the only information of a Reference is the SourceNode, the TargetNode, the ReferenceType and for asymmetric ReferenceTypes the direction (forward or inverse).\nSometimes, it is desirable to add more information to such a Reference. The concept of a ReferenceDescription keeps the simple Reference unchanged, and creates a Variable which is used to add more information about the Reference. Such a Variable can be referenced from the SourceNode and / or the TargetNode of such a Reference. Potentially, it can also be referenced by other Nodes to provide additional information (see also[5.2](/\u00A7_Ref63920887)). As Nodes can have several References, each ReferenceDescription Variable contains the unique definition of one Reference. An example is given in[Figure 2](/\u00A7_Ref63861017). ObjectA references ObjectB and ObjectC, each using the ReferenceType SomeReferenceType. Both References are described by a ReferenceDescription, that is, the Variables SomeReferenceType1 and SomeReferenceType2. The Values of those Variables uniquely identify the References by providing SourceNode, TargetNode, ReferenceType and direction. In the example, both ReferenceDescriptions have a Property with additional information, one called AdditionalInformationABC and the other AdditionalInformationXYZ."

      "Content": "One modelling construct to add information to References, is to provide an intermediate Object as proxy with additional information (see[Figure A.1](/\u00A7_Ref80774979)). The approach often makes sense. For example, to provide information about the physical cable connecting two devices represented as Nodes, another Node is added representing the cable, and both device Nodes are connected to the cable Node. The disadvantage of the approach is, that a Client cannot natively follow the Reference to the target directly, but always gets to the intermediate Object first and from there to the original target.  Therefore, the ReferenceDescription uses an approach, where the Reference directly connects both Nodes without the need to deal with an intermediate Object."
