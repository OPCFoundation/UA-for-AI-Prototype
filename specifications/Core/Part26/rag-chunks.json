      "Content": "The LogObjectType is an ObjectType that defines an instance that is used to collect log messages and make them available to a Client. An instance of LogObject can contain LogRecords that were generated internally. It can also contain LogRecords that result from Events that have a ConditionClassId or ConditionSubClassId of LogEntryConditionClassType that are reported by the Object on which the LogObject instance is declared (see[6](/\u00A7_Ref186755359)). The LogObject can also generate Events for LogRecords that were generated internally.\nThe underlying storage of LogRecords is not defined. The records could be stored as part of an EventHistory, the records could be stored in a[SYSLOG](/\u00A7Syslog)[OpenTelemetry](/\u00A7OpenT)[Annex A](/\u00A7_Ref184999788) for illustrations)\nAlthough this specification does not define how data is stored, a requirement to persist LogRecords(i.e. LogRecords will be retained following a restart) is defined in a ConformanceUnit and may be added to a Profile.\nThe LogObject exposes a Method that allows a Client to retrieve the LogRecords. This Method does not provide complex filtering, only a time range and Severity. It also provides a mask that allows the Client to select which fields in a LogRecord to return and a maximum number of records to return. Some instances of a LogObject may optionally expose HistoricalEvents which would allow a more complex Event retrieval filter (see HistoricalEvent retrieval in[OPC 10000-11](/\u00A7Part11)).\nThe LogObjectType is illustrated in[Figure 3](/\u00A7_Ref172052556)."

When this maximum is reached, a new log record will trigger the deletion of the oldest record. If this Variable is not provided, then there is no Server published limit on the log buffer. Zero is an invalid value for MaxRecords. The LogRecord Structure is defined in[5.4](/\u00A7_Ref184947648).\nOptional MaxStorageDuration defines the maximum time period that the LogObject will buffer log entries in the LogObject. Records that are older than the maximum duration may be deleted. If this Variable is not provided than no maximum duration is configured. Zero is an invalid duration. In the case of persistent storage, on startup a number of records may be deleted, depending on the duration of the downtime for the application.\nThe two maximum settings are used to limit the storage requirements for a Server. MaxRecords is typically a hard limit while MaxStorageDuration is more a soft limit in that LogRecords may be retained past the MaxStorageDuration if space allows. If MaxRecords is exceeded before MaxStorageDuration, the system should generate a LogOverflowEventType warning Event indicating an overflow of LogRecords(see[6.4](/\u00A7_Ref174908505)).\nThe MinimumSeverity describes the minimum Severity associated with a LogRecord that is stored. LogRecords with a Severity that is less then this number will not be stored in this LogObject. If omitted, there is no restriction on the Severity associated with LogRecords that are stored. This number shall be between 0 and 1000, any other number is illegal. S ervers can allow this value to be written. The Severity is only checked when a LogRecord is being generated, a change to the value does not affect the records that are already stored."

This context information can be used to show a relationship between various LogRecords in a Server as well as relationships between LogRecords that are in different Servers. This context information is stored in the TraceContext field in the record (see definition in[5.5.2](/\u00A7_Ref201444731)). If a hierarchy of related LogRecords is to be created, SpanId and ParentSpanId fields shall be used. When a function in a Server invokes another function in the same Server or in another Server as part of the same TraceId, the lower level function shall promote the SpanId of the higher level to be the ParentSpanId in the called function and a new SpanId shall be generated in the called function. This daisy chain of SpanId to ParentSpanId will allow a tree to be created for the LogRecords.\n[image007.png](images/image007.png)\nFigure 4- TraceContext hierarchy example\n[Figure 4](/\u00A7_Ref201386780) provides an illustration of the LogRecords that could result from calls between two Applications that include TraceContext information. The first line is each table is a list of the fields in the comma-separated-value records. These field names correspond to the names used in the LogRecord structure.\nThe key points being illustrated for the hierarchy are the TraceId, SpandId, ParentSpanId and ParentIdentifier field, which are the last 4 items in each LogRecord entry. The TraceId is shown as the GUID and is constant for this illustration (it is one action from the Client/Server).

For LogObjects that contain security related information should not be made accessible to all users, but only to authorised users.\nA LogObject can restrict a Client\u0027s access to the GetRecords Method using standard OPC UA security features. This all or nothing approach can work well if multiple LogObjects are defined in a Server and security related information is collected in a separate LogObject. It becomes more problematic if a single LogObject collects a mixture of security related information and non-security related information.\nLogObjects should implement permissions similar to what Event systems implement. In Event systems each Event has permissions assigned to it, in a LogObject each LogRecord can have permissions assigned to it. These permissions can be used to determine if a LogRecord should be returned to the Client that is invoking the GetRecords Method."

In the example, LogObjectArea2 would include all Events that would be available from the Area2 Object that have a ConditionClassId or ConditionSubClassId of LogEntryConditionClass. In addition the LogObject could store additional fields from Events in the AdditionalData NameValue pairs. What fields are be stored would be vendor / Server specific, but specifications that define LogObject instances may also define additional fields from defined Events that shall be stored in a LogRecord.\n[image008.png](images/image008.png)\nFigure 5- LogObject Event usage illustration"

In these cases, it would be useful to be able to collect log / trace information and import it into the OpenTelemetry system.\nIn OpenTelemetry, a client triggered action can be assigned a globally unique Trace_Id. This Trace_Id is maintained for all actions related to the client request. In addition, actions are grouped using a unique Span_Id. This Span_Id might be promoted to a Parent_Id, when a tree of related trace / log message needs to be generated. This process is illustrated in[Figure C.1](/\u00A7_Ref195832745). The Span_Id in OPC UA is an UInt64, and it should be unique inside of a TraceId inside of an application. An easy manner of achieving this is to just increment an UInt64 and persist the last value across the application."
