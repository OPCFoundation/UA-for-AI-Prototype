      "Content": "This part of the OPC UA Standard provides a definition of AliasNames functionality. AliasNames provide a manner of configuring and exposing an alternate well-defined name for any Node in the system. This is analogous to the way domain names are used as an alias to IP addresses in IP networks. Like a DNS Server, an OPC UA Server that supports AliasNames provides a lookup Method that will translate an AliasName to a NodeId of the related Node on a Server. An aggregating Server can collect these AliasNames from multiple Servers and provide a lookup Method to allow Client applications to discover NodeIds on a system wide basis. An aggregating Server could also define AliasNames for Nodes in other Servers that do not support AliasNames. A GDS may be constructed that would automatically aggregate all AliasNames that are defined on any Server that has registered with the GDS. In this case the GDS also provides the lookup mechanism for Clients at a well-known endpoint and address. Examples for the use of AliasNames are in[Annex A](/\u00A7_Ref172721279). The GDS functionality for AliasNames is formally defined in[Annex B](/\u00A7_Ref20155769)."

      "Content": "For systems that are large and complex, engineering is often done in multiple tools and by multiple individuals. The separate configurations are required to work together, but resolving the references between these different configurations can be a significant task. A common solution to simplify this task is a naming convention for the items that are being referenced. Providing an automatic lookup capability for these names would greatly simplify configuration. Each system can specify its own names and configurations can be built to just use the names, without having to know the exact address of the items. The exact address would include the address of the Server, the address of the tag in the Server, the required protocol for connecting to the Server, security settings etc. OPC UA defines a GDS that can provide information about what Servers are available in a system and how to connect to them, but it does not currently provide information about the tags that are available in a given Server."

An example tag is TI101, which is a temperature indicator at a specific location in a plant. The example nomenclature is defined in[ANSI/ISA-S5.1-1984 (R 1992)](/\u00A7ANSI), but this specification does not provide or even suggest any nomenclature. A Client could be configured to display or use the information provided by the sensor TI101, but the actual address/location of this sensor is often not known when the Client is configured. AliasNames can be used to resolve this tag to the actual sensor in the system.\nThe Client, on start-up or when it needs to access the tag, would call FindAlias on a local Server, aggregating Server or GDS depending on how a system is configured. A Client could select which AliasName source to call via a configuration setting. The FindAlias Method call would return a list of all ExpandedNodeIds that the AliasName References. It is important to note that there could be more than one Node referenced by an AliasName and that the Client must be prepared for this. The first Node in the list of referenced Nodes returned by FindAlias Method is the Node that the Server feels is the best match for the requested tag. The returned list could also return more than one instance of AliasNameType and each could have their own list of referenced Nodes. If the Method call was on a GDS or aggregating Server, the Client would need to read the ServerArray to resolve which Server the ExpandedNodeId was referencing. This would be the last piece of information that a Client would need to be able to follow a normal connection pattern to obtain values from the Node.\nAliasName"
