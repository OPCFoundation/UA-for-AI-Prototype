      "Content": "Figure 1 - Possible OPC UA Server supporting Historical Access\n\nThe Historian can be implemented as a standalone OPC UA Server that collects data from another OPC UA Server or another data source. The Historian can also just aggregate historical data from underlying Historians. The Client that references the OPC UA Server supporting Historical Access for historical data can be simple trending packages that desire values over a given time frame or they can be complex reports that require data in multiple formats.\nThere are general requirements for Historians, but Historians can vary in functionality. A consistent requirement for all Historians is that they store Historical data including a timestamp. All historical data should include status information for each value, but a Historian can compress this to only storing status information that indicates a problem (Bad status) and/or status change, instead of storing a status for every time series data item. The status of historical data can be complex. What is required is that the values returned as part of the timeseries raw data match the data that would have been observed if the Value was subscribed to at that point in time.\nHistorical Events are more complicated. In a stream of Events each Event can have a different list of fields. EventTypes are defined in a hierarchical manner, where each EventType inherits fields from its parent type and can add additional fields. Some of these additional fields can be mandatory and are required to understand or process the given EventType. A Historian that stores Events, shall be configurable to store all mandatory fields for any EventTypes that it historizes. If it receives for storage an EventType that it does not support all mandatory fields for, it can store it as one of its supertype EventTypes(one that it does support all mandatory fields for), but then it shall not claim that it supports historizing of that EventType(see[5.4.3](/\u00A7_Ref125565215)"

      "Content": "When an Historian is collecting and storing data, the data collection can be interrupted. The interruption can have been for collecting the current values of data or for an event stream. The interruption can have been due to an interruption in the source of a value or an interruption of the forwarding of historical data from an underlying Historian. The interruption can also have been due to an action that stopped the collection of HistoricalData or historical Events. Some of these interruptions can recover with no loss of data, others can result in data gaps. The Historian shall report any gaps when a client is accessing the stored historical data with an error code of Bad_ DataLost.\nFor example, if a subscription for data breaks, and the historian recovers the subscription after several minutes, it can check the SourceTimestamp of the initial values in the subscription. If the initial value SourceTimestamp matches the last stored value SourceTimestamp, then no data was lost and nothing needs to be stored indicating the given HistoricalDataNode\u0027s data collection was interrupted. But if the SourceTimestamp of the initial value is later than the SourceTimestamp of the last stored value, then the historian has no way of knowing if any data was lost and it shall record a bad status for the value with the timestamp of when the connection was broken.\nFor Event collection, in addition to what is described for a data collection the following also has to be addressed. If a Subscription for Event is interrupted for long enough that the Subscription buffer reports an overflow (instance of EventQueueOverflowEventType), then the Event storage shall report this error. This can be accomplished by storing the instance of EventQueueOverflowEventType event or by recording a Bad_ DataLost. If the lost data is indicated by EventQueueOverflowEventType, this event shall always be returned for any filter, just as it is in an Event Subscription."

      "Content": "A Historian collects values (data or Events) and provides long term storage of these values. Occasionally data that is collected is incorrect. It can be incorrect for many reasons, such as a failed sensor, or failed communication or even an out of calibration sensor. Sometimes the correct values are obtained from another source and the historical value is updated from this source. In many Historians, the act of updating a historical value needs to be tracked. This specification provides two aspects for tracking:\nRecording the original value and information related to who made the change (see[6.9](/\u00A7_Ref121430189) for HistoryUpdateDetails).\nGenerating an audit event describing the history edit action (see[5.8](/\u00A7_Ref121430142)).\nSome Historians obtain data from other sources (for example not an OPC UA Subscription). This data can be from lab data analysis package or other off-line activities. This data is typically provided in bulk and with SourceTimestamps that are in the past. For this type of data, even though it can be inserted using an HistoryUpdateDetails service call, the Historian does not have to create a modification record for the initial insertion.\nModification of Events is different than modification of data, in that in a single event stream there can be many Events with the same Timestamp. Events need to be identified by their EventId. The EventId is generated as part of normal Event processing in a Server and is used to correlate actions related to the Event. For example, when an Alarm (which is represented by an Event) is acknowledged, the acknowledgement is related to the specific EventId that represent that event is time. A Historian that historizes Events shall store the EventId that it receives; Modification of Events shall not allow modification to EventIds."

For a complete description of the Extensible Parameter HistoryReadDetails that include StartTime, EndTime and NumValuesPerNode, see[6.5](/\u00A7_Ref150152567). The concept of Bounding Values and how they affect the time domain that is requested as part of the HistoryRead request is further explained in 4.4. Subclause 4.4 also provides examples of TimeDomains to further illustrate the expected behaviour.\nWhen making a request for historical data using the HistoryRead Service, the required parameters include at least two of these three parameters: startTime, endTime and numValuesPerNode. What is returned when BoundingValues are requested varies according to which of these parameters are provided. For a Historian that has values stored at 5:00, 5:02, 5:03, 5:05 and 5:06, the data returned when using the Read Raw functionality is given by[Table 1](/\u00A7_Ref135728093). In the table, FIRST stands for a tuple with a value of null, a timestamp of the specified StartTime, and a StatusCode of Bad_BoundNotFound. LAST stands for a tuple with a value of null, a timestamp of the specified EndTime, and a StatusCode of Bad_ BoundNotFound.\nIn some cases, attempting to locate bounds, particularly FIRST or LAST points, can be resource intensive for Servers. Therefore, how far back or forward to look in history for Bounding Values is Server dependent, and the Server search limits can be reached before a bounding value can be found. There are also cases, such as reading Annotations or Attribute data where Bounding Values may not be appropriate. For such use cases it is permissible for the Server"

All HistoryAggregates supported by the Server should be able to be browsed starting from this Object. Aggregates are defined in[OPC 10000-13](/\u00A7).\nThe Stepped Variable specifies whether the historical data was collected in such a manner that it should be displayed as SlopedInterpolation(sloped line between points) or as SteppedInterpolation(vertically-connected horizontal lines between points) when RawData is examined. This Property also effects how some Aggregates are calculated. A value of True indicates the stepped interpolation mode. A value of False indicates SlopedInterpolation mode. The default value is False.\nThe Definition Variable is a vendor-specific, human readable string that specifies how the value of this HistoricalDataNode is calculated. Definition is non-localized and will often contain an equation that can be parsed by certain Clients.\nExample: Definition::= \u0022(TempA - 25) \u002B TempB\u0022\nThe MaxTimeInterval Variable specifies the maximum interval between data points in the history repository regardless of their value change (see[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7) for definition of Duration).\nThe MinTimeInterval Variable specifies the minimum interval between data points in the history repository regardless of their value change (see[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7) for definition of Duration)."

In this particular figure, we see a structure that outlines different layers or types within the context of historical access in IACS: 1. **Historical Access**: This seems to be the top-most layer, likely representing the concept of historical data management and access in an industrial control system. 2. **ReferenceType**: This is a broader category under Historical Access that might refer to different types or aspects related to the historical data. It includes:- **OPC UA (Universal Automation and Integration)**: Indicating that OPC UA standards are used in the context of historical access.- Two sub-categories, which appear to be specific types or components within the OPC UA framework:- **Hashed Data**: This might refer to data that has been processed using a hash function for security purposes.- **Non-persistent data/objects**: Indicating data that is not stored long-term and may be transient or temporary. 3. **OPC UA**: A standard protocol for providing services between clients and servers, for the secure exchange of data in industrial automation and other industries. It includes:- **OPC UA Client/Server**: This likely refers to the functional components that interact with the OPC UA Server and the OPC UA Server itself.- Four sub-categories, which could represent different modules or services within an OPC UA application:- **OPC UA Security**: Ensuring secure communication between clients and servers.- **OPC UA Discovery**: Possibly refers to the discovery of available devices and their capabilities on the network."

The EventFilter provides the filtering and content selection of Event Subscriptions. If an Event Notification conforms to the filter defined by the where parameter of the EventFilter, then the Notification is sent to the Client.\nIn historical Event retrieval the EventFilter represents the filtering and content selection used to describe what parameters of Events are available in history. These may or may not include all of the parameters of the real-time Event, i.e. not all fields available when the Event was generated can have been stored in history.\nThe HistoricalEventFilter can change over time so a Client can specify any field for any EventType in the EventFilter.

The value is opaque for the Client and is only used to maintain the state information for the Server to continue from. For HistoricalDataNode requests, a Server can use the timestamp of the last returned data item if the timestamp is unique. This can reduce the need in the Server to store state information for the ContinuationPoint.\nThe Client specifies the maximum number of results per operation in the request Message. A Server shall not return more than this number of results but it can return fewer results. The Server allocates a ContinuationPoint if there are more results to return. The Server can return fewer results due to buffer issues or other internal constraints. It can also be required to return a ContinuationPoint due to HistoryRead parameter constraints. If a request is taking a long time to calculate and is approaching the timeout time, the Server can return partial results with a ContinuationPoint. This can be done if the calculation is going to take more time than the Client timeout. In some cases, it can take longer than the Client timeout to calculate even one result. Then the Server can return zero results with a ContinuationPoint that allows the Server to resume the calculation on the next Client read call. For additional discussions regarding ContinuationPoints and HistoryRead please see the individual extensible HistoryReadDetails parameter in[6.5](/\u00A7_Ref150152567).\nIf the Client specifies a ContinuationPoint, then the HistoryReadDetails parameter and the TimestampsToReturn parameter shall be the same as in the original call.

The chart starts with an input of data from a historian system and then proceeds through various stages including:- Data validation for single-value nodes- Forcing a delay in results when needed- Evaluating if there is any error in the response- Analyzing operation status- A decision point to check if the value is inside a range- A calculation of the average value from the selected node- Outputting an error message and stopping the process if the range condition is not met- Finally, there\u0027s an output indicating \u0022Results ready\u0022 with a timestamp of 4:05 PM on 2/17/23.- There are several rows of data displayed in the spreadsheet, each row representing a different data point or time interval in the historian system. The values for \u0022Value\u0022 include numbers and percentage signs, suggesting that these may represent quantities or percentages. The image seems to be part of a presentation slide or an educational resource explaining how historical access is organized within an OPC UA environment.\nFigure 8- History Array example\n\n[Figure 9](/\u00A7_Ref127385246)"

This index range [1:2] contains more data and thus less Bad_ IndexRangeNoData is returned.\nThis image appears to be a screenshot from a computer interface showing a software application that is displaying a graphical representation of historical access data for an OPC UA system. The OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) standard is used for industrial automation and process control systems to enable secure, reliable exchange of real-time data between systems. In the screenshot, we can see a grid with rows representing individual access points and columns representing time stamps. The grid displays various status values for each point in time, including \u00270\u0027, which might indicate an unsuccessful attempt to access the system, and \u00271\u0027, indicating successful access. There are also some other numerical values in between that are not specified in the image, likely representing additional status codes or error messages. On the left side of the grid, there is a vertical bar labeled \u0022Votes,\u0022 which seems to indicate some form of performance metric for each access point, possibly counting how many times it has been accessed successfully or unsuccessfully. The numbers next to this bar are not fully visible due to the image\u0027s resolution. Below the grid, there\u0027s a flowchart that outlines the process of how data is organized and processed in the system: 1. **Data from different sources** - This suggests that there are multiple sources from which data is collected or generated. 2. **Combined into a table** - The data is organized into a structured format, likely for easy analysis and presentation. 3. **Index ranges and substrings** - This step involves grouping or filtering the data based on certain criteria or time intervals."

The interface also shows a red box with a checkmark inside it, which is often used to indicate an error or issue that has been resolved. There are also timestamps next to each access point, indicating when each event occurred.

The OPC UA specification does not allow for using a string representation to pass date/time information using the standard Services.\nOPC UA Client applications that wish to visually represent date/time in a relative string format shall convert this string format to UTC DateTime values before sending requests to the UA Server. It is recommended that all OPC UA Clients use the syntax defined in Clause A.1 to represent relative times in their user interfaces.\nThe format for the relative time is:\nkeyword\u002B/-offset\u002B/-offset\u2026\nwhere keyword and offset are as specified in[Table A.1](/\u00A7_Ref382912725) and Table[A.2](/\u00A7_Ref177563045) below. Whitespace is ignored. The time string shall begin with a keyword. Each offset shall be preceded by a signed integer that specifies the number and direction of the offset. If the integer preceding the offset is unsigned then the value of the preceding sign is assumed (beginning default sign is positive). The keyword refers to the beginning of the specified time period. DAY means the timestamp at the beginning of the current day (00:00 hours, midnight). MONTH means the timestamp at the beginning of the current month, etc."
