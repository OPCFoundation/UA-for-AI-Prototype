Some common examples are:\na temperature exceeding a configured limit\na device needing maintenance\na batch process that requires a user to confirm some step in the process before proceeding\nEach Condition instance is of a specific ConditionType. The ConditionType and derived types are sub-types of the BaseEventType(see[10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3) and[10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5)). This part defines types that are common across many industries. It is expected that vendors or other standardisation groups will define additional ConditionTypes deriving from the common base types defined in this part. The ConditionTypes supported by a Server are exposed in the AddressSpace of the Server.\nCondition instances are specific implementations of a ConditionType. It is up to the Server whether such instances are also exposed in the Server\u0027s AddressSpace. Clause[4.10](/\u00A7_Ref228157377) provides additional background about Condition instances. Condition instances shall have a unique identifier to differentiate them from other instances. This is independent of whether they are exposed in the AddressSpace.\nAs mentioned above, Conditions represent the state of a system or one of its components. In certain cases, however, previous states that still need attention are also maintained. ConditionBranches are introduced to deal with this requirement and distinguish current state and previous states. Each ConditionBranch has a BranchId that differentiates it from other branches of the same Condition instance. The ConditionBranch which represents the current state of the Condition(the trunk) has a NULL BranchId. Servers can generate separate Event Notifications for each branch. When the state represented by a ConditionBranch does not need further attention, a final Event Notification for this branch will have the Retain Property set to False. Clause"

However, Servers may provide access to Condition instances only while ConditionBranches exist.\nThe base Condition state model is illustrated in[Figure 11](/\u00A7_Ref396821605). It is extended by the various Condition subtypes defined in this document and may be further extended by vendors or other standardisation groups. The primary states of a Condition are disabled and enabled. The Disabled state is intended to allow Conditions to be turned off at the Server or below the Server(in a device or some underlying system). The Enabled state is normally extended with the addition of sub-states."

For example, acknowledgment of a related Condition may result in this Condition becoming acknowledged, or the Condition may be set up to automatically Acknowledge itself when the acknowledgeable situation disappears.\nTwo Acknowledge state models are supported by this document. Either of these state models can be extended to support more complex acknowledgement situations.\nThe basic Acknowledge state model is illustrated in[Figure 33](/\u00A7_Ref72848633). This model defines an AckedState. The specific state changes that result in a change to the state depend on a Server\u0027s implementation. For example, in typical Alarm models the change is limited to a transition to the Active state or transitions within the Active state. More complex models however can also allow for changes to the AckedState when the Condition transitions to an inactive state.\n[image006.png](images/image006.png)\nFigure 33- Acknowledge State Model\nA more complex state model which adds a confirmation to the basic Acknowledge is illustrated in[Figure 44](/\u00A7_Ref72848668). The Confirmed Acknowledge model is typically used to differentiate between acknowledging the presence of a Condition and having done something to address the Condition. For example, an Operator receiving a motor high temperature Notification calls the Acknowledge Method to inform the Server that the high temperature has been observed. The Operator then takes some action such as lowering the load on the motor in order to reduce the temperature. The Operator then calls the Confirm Method to inform the Server that a corrective action has been taken.\n[image007.png](images/image007.png)\nFigure 44- Confirm acknowledge State model\nThe AcknowledgeableConditions model can also be used for a simple Condition"

This means for example that Clients are not informed of currently Active Alarms until a new state change occurs.\nClients can obtain the current state of all Condition instances that are in an interesting state, by requesting a Refresh for a Subscription. It should be noted that Refresh is not a general replay capability since the Server is not required to maintain an Event history.\nClients request a Refresh by calling the ConditionRefresh Method. The Server will respond with a RefreshStartEventType Event. This Event is followed by the Retained Conditions. The Server may also send new Event Notifications interspersed with the Refresh related Event Notifications. After the Server is done with the Refresh, a RefreshEndEvent is issued marking the completion of the Refresh. Clients shall check for multiple Event Notifications for a ConditionBranch to avoid overwriting a new state delivered together with an older state from the Refresh process. If a ConditionBranch exists, then the current Condition shall be reported. This is True even if the only interesting item regarding the Condition is that ConditionBranches exist. This allows a Client to accurately represent the current Condition state.\nA Client that wishes to display the current status of Alarms and Conditions(known as a \u0022current Alarm display\u0022) would use the following logic to process Refresh Event Notifications. The Client flags all Retained Conditions as suspect on reception of the Event of the RefreshStartEventType. The Client adds any new Events that are received during the Refresh without flagging them as suspect. The Client also removes the suspect flag from any Retained Conditions that are returned as part of the Refresh. When the Client receives a RefreshEndEvent, the Client removes any remaining suspect Events, since they no longer apply."

Some Servers- in particular if they require acknowledgement of previous states - will maintain separate ConditionBranches for prior states that still need attention.\nConditionRefresh shall issue Event Notifications for all interesting states (current and previous) of a Condition instance and Clients can therefore receive more than one Event for a Condition instance with different BranchIds.\nIt is possible under some circumstances a Server is not capable of ensuring the Client is fully in sync with the current state of Condition instances. For example, if the underlying system represented by the Server is reset or communications are lost for some period of time it can be necessary for the Server to resynchronize itself with the underlying system. In these cases, the Server sends an Event of the RefreshRequiredEventType to advise the Client that a Refresh may be necessary. A Client receiving this special Event should initiate a ConditionRefresh as noted in this clause.\nTo ensure a Client is always informed, the three special EventTypes( RefreshEndEventType, RefreshStartEventType and RefreshRequiredEventType) ignore the Event content filtering associated with a Subscription and will always be delivered to the Client.\nConditionRefresh applies to a Subscription.

When an Alarm is an inactive state it is representing a situation that has returned to a normal state.\nSome Alarm subtypes introduce sub-states of the Active state. For example, an Alarm representing a temperature may provide a high level state as well as a critically high state (see following Clause).\nThe shelving state can be set by an Operator via OPC UA Methods. The suppressed state is set internally by the Server due to system specific reasons. Alarm systems typically implement the suppress, out of service and shelve features to help keep Operators from being overwhelmed during Alarm\u0022storms\u0022 by limiting the number of Alarms an Operator sees on a current Alarm display. This is accomplished by setting the SuppressedOrShelved flag on second order dependent Alarms and/or Alarms of less severity, leading the Operator to concentrate on the most critical issues.\nThe LatchedState is a state that is added to any alarm that requires additional processing, once it goes active it does not clear until it is explicitly reset, even if the value that triggered the alarm returns to normal. This can be an alarm that requires a physical inspection once it has occurred to ensure it is no longer in alarm, or a series of tests that might be required to ensure the alarm is no longer active or some other actions. Any AlarmType can become a latched alarm by the addition of this optional sub-state.\nThe shelved, out of service and suppressed states differ from the Disabled state in that Alarms are still fully functional and can be included in Subscription Notifications to a Client. A disabled Alarm is not processed in any manner, and is not supported as part of the active Alarm model defined in ISA 18.2."

Audit records are generated for all Method calls that affect the state of the system, for example, an Acknowledge Method call would generate an AuditConditionAcknowledgeEventType Event.\nThe standard AuditEventTypes defined in[10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) already include the fields required for Condition related audit records. To allow for filtering and grouping, this document defines a number of sub-types of the AuditEventTypes but without adding new fields to them.\nThis document describes the AuditEventType that each Method shall generate if Audit Events are supported by the Server. For example, the Disable Method has an AlwaysGeneratesEvent Reference to an AuditConditionEnableEventType. An Event of this type shall be generated for every invocation of the Method if audit events are supported. The audit Event describes the user interaction with the system, in some cases this interaction may affect more than one Condition or be related to more than one state."

      "Content": "In a system, alarms might be managed at different levels and by different applications. An alarm might be detected in an instrument, but the full alarm model for that alarm instance might be maintained in a higher level Server. This can cause issues in cases where the instrument is restarted or the UA Server that is acting as an alarm server is restarted. It is desirable that the state of alarms is maintained and that after any restart of either application all alarms recover their same state as before the restart. But it is acceptable if an alarm might require some management actions again following a restart. It is not acceptable that a device that is in alarm is no longer reported as being in alarm. For example, if the AlarmManager is restarted, when it recovers, can detect that the device has an alarm, but possibly not be able to recover that the alarm has a comment or that it was acknowledged. The individual Objects models provide details about Alarm states and recovery."

The BranchId DataType is NodeId although the Server is not required to have ConditionBranches in the AddressSpace. The use of a NodeId allows the Server to use simple numeric identifiers, strings or arrays of bytes.\nRetain when True describes a Condition(or ConditionBranch) as being in a state that is interesting for a Client wishing to synchronize its state with the Server\u0027s state. The logic to determine how this flag is set is Server specific. Typically, all Active Alarms would have the Retain flag set; however, it is also possible for inactive Alarms to have their Retain flag set to True.\nIn normal processing when a Client receives an Event with the Retain flag set to False, the Client should consider this as a ConditionBranch that is no longer of interest, in the case of a \u0022current Alarm display\u0022 the ConditionBranch would be removed from the display.\nSupportsFilteredRetain Property is only provided on the ConditionType. When this Property is set to True on the Type, then the Server provides a Client specific Retain flag value taking into account any Client provided filter. When the property is False on the ConditionType then the Server does not provide a Client specific the value of the Retain flag. For example, if a Client applies a filter to exclude Alarms that are shelved, and the SupportsFilteredRetain is set to True, the Client receives an Alarm(it is not shelved, Retain is true).

Recommended state names are described in[A.1](/\u00A7_Ref96212959).

These three suppressions are generally used by different personnel or systems at a plant, i.e. automatic systems, maintenance personnel and Operators.\nSuppressedState is used internally by a Server to automatically suppress Alarms due to system specific reasons. For example, a system may be configured to suppress Alarms that are associated with machinery that is in a state such as shutdown. For example, a low level Alarm for a tank that is currently not in use might be suppressed. Recommended state names are described in[A.1](/\u00A7_Ref96213027).

Recommended state names are described in[A.1](/\u00A7_Ref78233403). In the event of a restart of an AlarmManager, the AlarmManager should recover the OutOfServiceState. If the system cannot determine if the alarm is OutOfService, the state shall be set to false (not OutOfService).\nShelvingState suggests whether an Alarm shall (temporarily) be prevented from being displayed to the user. It is quite often used by Operators to block nuisance Alarms. The ShelvingState is defined in[5.8.17](/\u00A7_Ref387228808).\nWhen an Alarm has any or all of the SuppressedState, OutOfServiceState or ShelvingState set to True, the SuppressedOrShelved property shall be set True and this Alarm is then typically not displayed by the Client.

The OnDelay is used to avoid unnecessary Alarms when a signal temporarily overshoots its setpoint, thus preventing the Alarm from being triggered until the signal remains in the Alarm state continuously for a specified length of time ( OnDelay time). The OffDelay is used to reduce chattering Alarms by locking the Alarm indication for a certain holding period after the condition has returned to normal. I.e., the Alarm shall stay active for the OffDelay time and shall not regenerate if it returns to active in that period. If the Alarm remains in the inactive zone for OffDelay it will then become inactive.\nThe optional variable FirstInGroupFlag is used together with the FirstInGroup object. The FirstInGroup Object is an instance of an AlarmGroupType that groups a number of related Alarm s. The FirstInGroupFlag is set on the Alarm instance that was the first Alarm to trigger in a FirstInGroup. If this variable is present, then the FirstInGroup shall also be present. These two nodes allow an alarming system to determine which Alarm in the list was the trigger. It is commonly used in situations where Alarms are interrelated and usually multiple Alarm s occur. For example, vibration sensors in a turbine, usually all sensors trigger if any one triggers, but what is important for an Operator is the first sensor that triggered.\nThe LatchedState Object, if present, indicates that this Alarm supports being latched.

      "Content": "The ShelvedStateMachineType defines a sub-state machine that represents an advanced Alarm filtering model. This model is illustrated in[Figure 1717](/\u00A7_Ref209428072).\nThe state model supports two types of Shelving: OneShotShelving and TimedShelving. They are illustrated in[Figure 1616](/\u00A7_Ref209428101). The illustration includes the allowed transitions between the various sub-states. Shelving is an Operator initiated activity.\nIn OneShotShelving, a user requests that an Alarm be Shelved for its current Active state or if not Active its next Active state. This type of Shelving is typically used when an Alarm is continually occurring on a boundary (i.e. a Condition is jumping between High Alarm and HighHigh Alarm, always in the Active state). The OneShotShelving will automatically clear when an Alarm returns to an inactive state. Another use for this type of Shelving is for a plant area that is shutdown i.e. a long running Alarm such as a low level Alarm for a tank that is not in use. When the tank starts operation again the Shelving state will automatically clear.\nIn TimedShelving, a user specifies that an Alarm be shelved for a fixed time period. This type of Shelving is quite often used to block nuisance Alarms. For example, an Alarm that occurs more than 10 times in a minute may get shelved for a few minutes. The Alarm is shelved for the time period, no matter how many transitions the Alarm has between Active state and Inactive state.\nIn all states, the Unshelve can be called to cause a transition to the Unshelve state; this includes Un-shelving an Alarm that is in the TimedShelve"

In the event of a restart of an AlarmManager, the AlarmManager should recover the ShelvedStateMachine. If the system cannot determine if the state of the ShelvedStateMachine for a given alarm instance, the ShelvedStateMachine shall be set to Unshelved.\nAll but two transitions are caused by Method calls as illustrated in[Figure 1616](/\u00A7_Ref209428101). The \u0022Time Expired\u0022 transition is simply a system generated transition that occurs when the time value defined as part of the \u0022Timed Shelved Call\u0022 has expired. The \u0022Any Transition Occurs\u0022 transition is also a system generated transition; this transition is generated when the Condition goes to an inactive state."

If the setpoint is changed to 11 then the new deviation values would be 10 and 13 respectively. The setpoint can be fixed by a configuration, adjusted by an Operator or it can be adjusted by an algorithm, the actual functionality exposed by the setpoint is application specific. The deviation Alarm can also be used to report a problem between a redundant data source where the difference between the primary source and the secondary source exceeds the included limit. In this case, the SetpointNode would point to the secondary source.\nThe LowLimit and LowLowLimit shall be negative, indicating a number below the target value and the HighLimit and HighHighLimit shall be positive, indicating a number above the target value.

These Alarms might be directly Referenced by an Object or they might have no direct References from the Object to the Alarm. Alarms might also be related to Objects that are nested under the Object. When the Object is represented in a graphic in a plant, it is often important to be able to see if there is an active Alarm associated with it. This indication could just be a flashing value or flashing image or a change in colour of the image.\n[image034.png](images/image034.png)\nFigure 3030- AlarmSummary equipment example\nFor example, if there is a tank (illustrated in[Figure 3030](/\u00A7_Ref97508524)). The tank might have a level meter, a temperature gauge and a pressure gauge. It might also have a flow meter on both an inlet and an outlet. The tank might also have a pressure release valve. The information model that might result from this equipment is illustrated in[Figure 3131](/\u00A7_Ref97509311)\n[image035.png](images/image035.png)\nFigure 3131- AlarmSummary Equipment Object Example\nAll of these sub-objects might have unique alarms associated with them, such as limit alarms on the temperature and levels, maybe rate of change alarm as well as limit alarms on the pressure. Maybe some advanced Alarms that are associated with the tank for an invalid state (in the inlet flow \u003E 0 and the outlet flow is \u003E 0). Maybe a discrete alarm on the pressure release valve, i.e. when it is open it is an alarm. The overall alarm state of the Tank could be displayed on a graphic or maybe the LevelTransmitter\u0027s value is to indicate that there is an alarm associated with the value."

      "Content": "The goal of a well-designed alarm system is to ensure that an Operator is made aware of issues, both critical and non-critical, but is not overwhelmed by alarms/alerts or other messages. When designing an alarm system, criteria are defined for alarm rates and general performance of the system at various levels ( Operator station, plant area, overall system etc.). Evaluating the performance of an alarm system with regard to these design criteria requires the collection of alarm metrics. These metrics provide summaries of alarm rates and other alarm related information.\nThis section defines a standard structure for metrics. This structure can be implemented at multiple levels allowing a Server to collect metrics as needed. For example, an Object of this type might be added to the Server Object providing a summary of the Alarm performance for the entire Server. An instance might also be provided on an Object that includes a HasNotifier hierarchy, such as a tank Object. In this case, it would provide the summary of all of the Alarms that are part of the tank HasNotifier hierarchy."

It also illustrates how ReAlarmTime is used to bring an alarm back up to an active state (see[Figure B.44](/\u00A7_Ref103633802)).\nSome process values may have sudden jumps that are very brief and do not constitute an alarm. For example, a motor on start draws a large current, but quickly come back down. This is a normal motor current load, and should not be alarmed, but a sustained current load is a problem and should be alarmed, by configuring a OnDelay time, the momentary spike will not generate an alarm, since the value has to be above the alarm threshold for the duration of OnDelay.\nAn AlarmDeadband is used to keep a noise signal from generating multiple Alarm activations a signal once it crosses an alarm limit will not return to norm unless it drops below the limit by the amount of the deadband specified. In the example the process value is jumping up and down around the limit, but the alarm just remains in the same active or acknowledged state. The Alarm can have a deadband for each limit (High vs HighHigh) and these deadbands can be different.\nThe OffDelay can also be used, much as the OnDelay, except it will keep a Value in alarm even if it drops below a limit, but only very briefly. Again, this setting is used to limit the number of alarms that occur in a system.\nThe ReAlarmTime"

In order to maintain a high degree of consistency and interoperability, it is strongly recommended that vendors, who choose to implement their own version of the A\u0026E COM UA Proxy, follow these same guidelines and constraints.\nThe A\u0026E COM Client simply addresses how to connect to the UA A \u0026 C Server. Connectivity approaches include the one where A\u0026E COM Clients connect to a UA A \u0026 C Server with a CLSID just as if the target Server were an A\u0026E COM Server. However, the CLSID can be considered virtual since it is defined to connect to intermediary components that ultimately connect to the UA A \u0026 C Server. Using this approach, the A\u0026E COM Client calls co-create instance with a virtual CLSID as described above. This connects to the A\u0026E COM UA Proxy components. The A\u0026E COM UA Proxy then establishes a secure channel and session with the UA A \u0026 C Server. As a result, the A\u0026E COM Client gets a COM Event Server interface pointer."

OPC UA does not provide visual indication but it does provide priority information on which the client can be configured to provide the appropriate visual display.

The transitions are defined in[Table F.22](/\u00A7_Ref28217027).\nThe StateMachine supports six possible states including: Operating, ShuttingDown, StartingUp, Shutdown, OutOfService, Maintenance. It supports 12 possible Transitions and 7 possible Methods.\nTable F. 22- SystemStateStateMachineType additional references\nSourceBrowsePath\nReferences\nIsForward\nTargetBrowsePath\nShutdownToOperating\nFromState\nTrue\nShutdown\n\nToState\nTrue\nOperating\n\nHasCause\nTrue\nQuickStart\nOperatingToShutdown\nFromState\nTrue\nOperating\n\nToState\nTrue\nShutdown\n\nHasCause\nTrue\nQuickShutdown\nShuttingDownToShutdown\nFromState\nTrue\nShuttingDown\n\nToState\nTrue\nShutdown\nOperatingToShuttingDown\nFromState\nTrue\nOperating\n\nToState\nTrue\nShuttingDown\n\nHasCause\nTrue\nStop\nStartingUpToOperating\nFromState\nTrue\nStartingUp\n\nToState\nTrue"

No HasEffect References are defined, but an implementation might define HasEffect References(such as HasEffectDisable) for disabling or enabling Alarms, suppressing Alarms or adjusting setpoints or limits of Alarms. The targets of the reference might be an individual Alarm or portion of a plant or piece of equipment. See section[7](/\u00A7_Ref474969866) for a list of HasEffect References that could be used.\n\nBibliography\n10000-26: OPC UA Specification: Part 26 - LogObjects\n[https://www.opcfoundation.org/UA/Part26/](https://www.opcfoundation.org/UA/Part26/)\nIETF RFC 2045: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part One\n[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt ](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt)\nIETF RFC 2046: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two\n[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt ](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt)"
