Some common examples are:\na temperature exceeding a configured limit\na device needing maintenance\na batch process that requires a user to confirm some step in the process before proceeding\nEach Condition instance is of a specific ConditionType. The ConditionType and derived types are sub-types of the BaseEventType(see[10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3) and[10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5)). This part defines types that are common across many industries. It is expected that vendors or other standardisation groups will define additional ConditionTypes deriving from the common base types defined in this part. The ConditionTypes supported by a Server are exposed in the AddressSpace of the Server.\nCondition instances are specific implementations of a ConditionType. It is up to the Server whether such instances are also exposed in the Server\u0027s AddressSpace. Clause[4.10](/\u00A7_Ref228157377) provides additional background about Condition instances. Condition instances shall have a unique identifier to differentiate them from other instances. This is independent of whether they are exposed in the AddressSpace.\nAs mentioned above, Conditions represent the state of a system or one of its components. In certain cases, however, previous states that still need attention are also maintained. ConditionBranches are introduced to deal with this requirement and distinguish current state and previous states. Each ConditionBranch has a BranchId that differentiates it from other branches of the same Condition instance. The ConditionBranch which represents the current state of the Condition(the trunk) has a NULL BranchId. Servers can generate separate Event Notifications for each branch. When the state represented by a ConditionBranch does not need further attention, a final Event Notification for this branch will have the Retain Property set to False. Clause"

However, Servers may provide access to Condition instances only while ConditionBranches exist.\nThe base Condition state model is illustrated in[Figure 11](/\u00A7_Ref396821605). It is extended by the various Condition subtypes defined in this document and may be further extended by vendors or other standardisation groups. The primary states of a Condition are disabled and enabled. The Disabled state is intended to allow Conditions to be turned off at the Server or below the Server(in a device or some underlying system). The Enabled state is normally extended with the addition of sub-states."

For example, acknowledgment of a related Condition may result in this Condition becoming acknowledged, or the Condition may be set up to automatically Acknowledge itself when the acknowledgeable situation disappears.\nTwo Acknowledge state models are supported by this document. Either of these state models can be extended to support more complex acknowledgement situations.\nThe basic Acknowledge state model is illustrated in[Figure 33](/\u00A7_Ref72848633). This model defines an AckedState. The specific state changes that result in a change to the state depend on a Server\u0027s implementation. For example, in typical Alarm models the change is limited to a transition to the Active state or transitions within the Active state. More complex models however can also allow for changes to the AckedState when the Condition transitions to an inactive state.\n[image006.png](images/image006.png)\nFigure 33- Acknowledge State Model\nA more complex state model which adds a confirmation to the basic Acknowledge is illustrated in[Figure 44](/\u00A7_Ref72848668). The Confirmed Acknowledge model is typically used to differentiate between acknowledging the presence of a Condition and having done something to address the Condition. For example, an Operator receiving a motor high temperature Notification calls the Acknowledge Method to inform the Server that the high temperature has been observed. The Operator then takes some action such as lowering the load on the motor in order to reduce the temperature. The Operator then calls the Confirm Method to inform the Server that a corrective action has been taken.\n[image007.png](images/image007.png)\nFigure 44- Confirm acknowledge State model\nThe AcknowledgeableConditions model can also be used for a simple Condition"

In situations where state changes occur in short succession there can be multiple unacknowledged states and the Server maintains ConditionBranches for all previous unacknowledged states.

This means for example that Clients are not informed of currently Active Alarms until a new state change occurs.\nClients can obtain the current state of all Condition instances that are in an interesting state, by requesting a Refresh for a Subscription. It should be noted that Refresh is not a general replay capability since the Server is not required to maintain an Event history.\nClients request a Refresh by calling the ConditionRefresh Method. The Server will respond with a RefreshStartEventType Event. This Event is followed by the Retained Conditions. The Server may also send new Event Notifications interspersed with the Refresh related Event Notifications. After the Server is done with the Refresh, a RefreshEndEvent is issued marking the completion of the Refresh. Clients shall check for multiple Event Notifications for a ConditionBranch to avoid overwriting a new state delivered together with an older state from the Refresh process. If a ConditionBranch exists, then the current Condition shall be reported. This is True even if the only interesting item regarding the Condition is that ConditionBranches exist. This allows a Client to accurately represent the current Condition state.\nA Client that wishes to display the current status of Alarms and Conditions(known as a \u0022current Alarm display\u0022) would use the following logic to process Refresh Event Notifications. The Client flags all Retained Conditions as suspect on reception of the Event of the RefreshStartEventType. The Client adds any new Events that are received during the Refresh without flagging them as suspect. The Client also removes the suspect flag from any Retained Conditions that are returned as part of the Refresh. When the Client receives a RefreshEndEvent, the Client removes any remaining suspect Events, since they no longer apply."

For example, if the underlying system represented by the Server is reset or communications are lost for some period of time it can be necessary for the Server to resynchronize itself with the underlying system. In these cases, the Server sends an Event of the RefreshRequiredEventType to advise the Client that a Refresh may be necessary. A Client receiving this special Event should initiate a ConditionRefresh as noted in this clause.\nTo ensure a Client is always informed, the three special EventTypes( RefreshEndEventType, RefreshStartEventType and RefreshRequiredEventType) ignore the Event content filtering associated with a Subscription and will always be delivered to the Client.\nConditionRefresh applies to a Subscription.

When an Alarm is an inactive state it is representing a situation that has returned to a normal state.\nSome Alarm subtypes introduce sub-states of the Active state. For example, an Alarm representing a temperature may provide a high level state as well as a critically high state (see following Clause).\nThe shelving state can be set by an Operator via OPC UA Methods. The suppressed state is set internally by the Server due to system specific reasons. Alarm systems typically implement the suppress, out of service and shelve features to help keep Operators from being overwhelmed during Alarm\u0022storms\u0022 by limiting the number of Alarms an Operator sees on a current Alarm display. This is accomplished by setting the SuppressedOrShelved flag on second order dependent Alarms and/or Alarms of less severity, leading the Operator to concentrate on the most critical issues.\nThe LatchedState is a state that is added to any alarm that requires additional processing, once it goes active it does not clear until it is explicitly reset, even if the value that triggered the alarm returns to normal. This can be an alarm that requires a physical inspection once it has occurred to ensure it is no longer in alarm, or a series of tests that might be required to ensure the alarm is no longer active or some other actions. Any AlarmType can become a latched alarm by the addition of this optional sub-state.\nThe shelved, out of service and suppressed states differ from the Disabled state in that Alarms are still fully functional and can be included in Subscription Notifications to a Client. A disabled Alarm is not processed in any manner, and is not supported as part of the active Alarm model defined in ISA 18.2."

Audit records are generated for all Method calls that affect the state of the system, for example, an Acknowledge Method call would generate an AuditConditionAcknowledgeEventType Event.\nThe standard AuditEventTypes defined in[10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) already include the fields required for Condition related audit records. To allow for filtering and grouping, this document defines a number of sub-types of the AuditEventTypes but without adding new fields to them.\nThis document describes the AuditEventType that each Method shall generate if Audit Events are supported by the Server. For example, the Disable Method has an AlwaysGeneratesEvent Reference to an AuditConditionEnableEventType. An Event of this type shall be generated for every invocation of the Method if audit events are supported. The audit Event describes the user interaction with the system, in some cases this interaction may affect more than one Condition or be related to more than one state."

      "Content": "In a system, alarms might be managed at different levels and by different applications. An alarm might be detected in an instrument, but the full alarm model for that alarm instance might be maintained in a higher level Server. This can cause issues in cases where the instrument is restarted or the UA Server that is acting as an alarm server is restarted. It is desirable that the state of alarms is maintained and that after any restart of either application all alarms recover their same state as before the restart. But it is acceptable if an alarm might require some management actions again following a restart. It is not acceptable that a device that is in alarm is no longer reported as being in alarm. For example, if the AlarmManager is restarted, when it recovers, can detect that the device has an alarm, but possibly not be able to recover that the alarm has a comment or that it was acknowledged. The individual Objects models provide details about Alarm states and recovery."

It contains a human readable name for the current state after taking the state of any SubStateMachines in account.

The SourceNode Property is the Node, which the Condition is associated with, it may be the same as the InputNode for an Alarm, but it may be a separate node. For example, a motor, which is a Variable with a Value that is an RPM, may be the ConditionSource for Conditions that are related to the motor as well as a temperature sensor associated with the motor. In the former the InputNode for the High RPM Alarm is the value of the Motor RPM, while in the later the InputNode of the High Alarm would be the value of the temperature sensor that is associated with the motor.\nConditionClassId, ConditionClassName, ConditionSubClassId and ConditionSubClassName originally defined in ConditionType are now defined in the BaseEventType(from which this type is derived). They are optional in the BaseEventType, but ConditionClassId, and ConditionClassName are Mandatory in ConditionType and thus listed(to update the modelling rule).\nConditionName identifies the Condition instance that the Event originated from. It can be used together with the SourceName in a user display to distinguish between different Condition instances.

The logic to determine how this flag is set is Server specific. Typically, all Active Alarms would have the Retain flag set; however, it is also possible for inactive Alarms to have their Retain flag set to True.\nIn normal processing when a Client receives an Event with the Retain flag set to False, the Client should consider this as a ConditionBranch that is no longer of interest, in the case of a \u0022current Alarm display\u0022 the ConditionBranch would be removed from the display.\nSupportsFilteredRetain Property is only provided on the ConditionType.

The Client(or another Client) shelves the Alarm. At this point the Alarm no longer passes the filter, but since the previous event was sent, this event is transmitted with Retain = False.

In some systems, an Alarm may be calculated based on multiple Variables Values; it is up to the system to determine which Variable\u0027s NodeId is used.\nSuppressedState, OutOfServiceState and ShelvingState together allow the suppression of Alarms on display systems. These three suppressions are generally used by different personnel or systems at a plant, i.e. automatic systems, maintenance personnel and Operators.\nSuppressedState is used internally by a Server to automatically suppress Alarms due to system specific reasons.

If the system cannot determine if the alarm is Suppressed, the state shall be set to false (not Suppressed).\nOutOfServiceState is used by maintenance personnel to suppress Alarms due to a maintenance issue.

The OnDelay is used to avoid unnecessary Alarms when a signal temporarily overshoots its setpoint, thus preventing the Alarm from being triggered until the signal remains in the Alarm state continuously for a specified length of time ( OnDelay time). The OffDelay is used to reduce chattering Alarms by locking the Alarm indication for a certain holding period after the condition has returned to normal. I.e., the Alarm shall stay active for the OffDelay time and shall not regenerate if it returns to active in that period. If the Alarm remains in the inactive zone for OffDelay it will then become inactive.\nThe optional variable FirstInGroupFlag is used together with the FirstInGroup object.

The FirstInGroupFlag is set on the Alarm instance that was the first Alarm to trigger in a FirstInGroup. If this variable is present, then the FirstInGroup shall also be present. These two nodes allow an alarming system to determine which Alarm in the list was the trigger. It is commonly used in situations where Alarms are interrelated and usually multiple Alarm s occur.

The Method cannot be called with an ObjectId of the AlarmConditionType Node.\nSignature\nUnsuppress\n\nMethod Result Codes in[Table 5656](/\u00A7_Ref87994789)(defined in Call Service).\nTable 5656 - Unsuppress result codes"

      "Content": "The ShelvedStateMachineType defines a sub-state machine that represents an advanced Alarm filtering model. This model is illustrated in[Figure 1717](/\u00A7_Ref209428072).\nThe state model supports two types of Shelving: OneShotShelving and TimedShelving. They are illustrated in[Figure 1616](/\u00A7_Ref209428101). The illustration includes the allowed transitions between the various sub-states. Shelving is an Operator initiated activity.\nIn OneShotShelving, a user requests that an Alarm be Shelved for its current Active state or if not Active its next Active state. This type of Shelving is typically used when an Alarm is continually occurring on a boundary (i.e. a Condition is jumping between High Alarm and HighHigh Alarm, always in the Active state). The OneShotShelving will automatically clear when an Alarm returns to an inactive state. Another use for this type of Shelving is for a plant area that is shutdown i.e. a long running Alarm such as a low level Alarm for a tank that is not in use. When the tank starts operation again the Shelving state will automatically clear.\nIn TimedShelving, a user specifies that an Alarm be shelved for a fixed time period. This type of Shelving is quite often used to block nuisance Alarms. For example, an Alarm that occurs more than 10 times in a minute may get shelved for a few minutes. The Alarm is shelved for the time period, no matter how many transitions the Alarm has between Active state and Inactive state.\nIn all states, the Unshelve can be called to cause a transition to the Unshelve state; this includes Un-shelving an Alarm that is in the TimedShelve"

In the event of a restart of an AlarmManager, the AlarmManager should recover the ShelvedStateMachine. If the system cannot determine if the state of the ShelvedStateMachine for a given alarm instance, the ShelvedStateMachine shall be set to Unshelved.\nAll but two transitions are caused by Method calls as illustrated in[Figure 1616](/\u00A7_Ref209428101). The \u0022Time Expired\u0022 transition is simply a system generated transition that occurs when the time value defined as part of the \u0022Timed Shelved Call\u0022 has expired. The \u0022Any Transition Occurs\u0022 transition is also a system generated transition; this transition is generated when the Condition goes to an inactive state."

The deviation Alarm becomes active when the deviation exceeds or drops below a defined limit.\nFor example, if a setpoint had a value of 10, a high deviation Alarm limit of 2 and a low deviation Alarm limit of -1 then the low sub state is entered if the process value drops below 9; the high sub state is entered if the process value raises above 12. If the setpoint is changed to 11 then the new deviation values would be 10 and 13 respectively. The setpoint can be fixed by a configuration, adjusted by an Operator or it can be adjusted by an algorithm, the actual functionality exposed by the setpoint is application specific. The deviation Alarm can also be used to report a problem between a redundant data source where the difference between the primary source and the secondary source exceeds the included limit. In this case, the SetpointNode would point to the secondary source.\nThe LowLimit and LowLowLimit shall be negative, indicating a number below the target value and the HighLimit and HighHighLimit shall be positive, indicating a number above the target value. If provided, the limits shall not be zero and shall follow these rules:\nHighHighLimit \u003E HighLimit\nLowLimit \u003E LowLowLimit.\nFor example, if the LowLimit is -2 then a LowLowLimit of -1 would not be allowed, but a LowLowLimit of -3 would be allowed."

For example, a tank may have a High limit for the rate of change of its level (measured in meters) which would be 4 meters per minute. If the tank level changes at a rate that is greater than 4 meters per minute then the High sub state is entered."

Maybe some advanced Alarms that are associated with the tank for an invalid state (in the inlet flow \u003E 0 and the outlet flow is \u003E 0). Maybe a discrete alarm on the pressure release valve, i.e. when it is open it is an alarm.

      "Content": "The goal of a well-designed alarm system is to ensure that an Operator is made aware of issues, both critical and non-critical, but is not overwhelmed by alarms/alerts or other messages. When designing an alarm system, criteria are defined for alarm rates and general performance of the system at various levels ( Operator station, plant area, overall system etc.). Evaluating the performance of an alarm system with regard to these design criteria requires the collection of alarm metrics. These metrics provide summaries of alarm rates and other alarm related information.\nThis section defines a standard structure for metrics. This structure can be implemented at multiple levels allowing a Server to collect metrics as needed. For example, an Object of this type might be added to the Server Object providing a summary of the Alarm performance for the entire Server. An instance might also be provided on an Object that includes a HasNotifier hierarchy, such as a tank Object. In this case, it would provide the summary of all of the Alarms that are part of the tank HasNotifier hierarchy."

      "Content": "An instance of AlarmMetricsType can be added, with a HasComponent reference, to any Object that has its \u0022SubscribeToEvents\u0022 bit set within the EventNotifier Attribute. It will collect the Alarm metrics for all Alarm sources assigned to this notifier Object. For example, if Alarm metrics are desired for Tank A Object(see[Figure B.55](/\u00A7_Ref382998496)) that is in the HasNotifier hierarchy than an instance of this object would be referenced by the Tank A object. When this object is associated with the Server Object it will report Alarm metrics for the entire Server.\nAlarmCount is the total count of Alarms since the last restart of the system or reset of this counter.\nStartTime is the time at which the Server started or the time of the last Reset Method invocation, whichever is later.\nMaximumActiveState is the maximum time for which an Alarm was in the active state.\nMaximumUnAck is the maximum time for which an Alarm was in the unacknowledged state.\nCurrentAlarmRate is the sum of Alarms that occurred in the last Rate number of minutes (see[9.3](/\u00A7_Ref477254172)). This sum should not include nuisance Alarms (i.e. chattering alarms). It is updated every Rate number of minutes.\nMaximumAlarmRate is the maximum Alarm rate detected since the start of the Server, where the rate is calculated as for CurrentAlarmRate.\nMaximumReAlarmCount is the maximum ReAlarmCount for any Alarm.\nAverageAlarmRate is the average Alarm rate since the start of the Server or the last invocation of Reset Method, where the rate is calculated as for CurrentAlarmRate.\nReset is a Method that will reset all of the counters, rates or times in this Object"

It also illustrates how ReAlarmTime is used to bring an alarm back up to an active state (see[Figure B.44](/\u00A7_Ref103633802)).\nSome process values may have sudden jumps that are very brief and do not constitute an alarm. For example, a motor on start draws a large current, but quickly come back down. This is a normal motor current load, and should not be alarmed, but a sustained current load is a problem and should be alarmed, by configuring a OnDelay time, the momentary spike will not generate an alarm, since the value has to be above the alarm threshold for the duration of OnDelay.\nAn AlarmDeadband is used to keep a noise signal from generating multiple Alarm activations a signal once it crosses an alarm limit will not return to norm unless it drops below the limit by the amount of the deadband specified. In the example the process value is jumping up and down around the limit, but the alarm just remains in the same active or acknowledged state. The Alarm can have a deadband for each limit (High vs HighHigh) and these deadbands can be different.\nThe OffDelay can also be used, much as the OnDelay, except it will keep a Value in alarm even if it drops below a limit, but only very briefly. Again, this setting is used to limit the number of alarms that occur in a system.\nThe ReAlarmTime"

In order to maintain a high degree of consistency and interoperability, it is strongly recommended that vendors, who choose to implement their own version of the A\u0026E COM UA Proxy, follow these same guidelines and constraints.\nThe A\u0026E COM Client simply addresses how to connect to the UA A \u0026 C Server. Connectivity approaches include the one where A\u0026E COM Clients connect to a UA A \u0026 C Server with a CLSID just as if the target Server were an A\u0026E COM Server. However, the CLSID can be considered virtual since it is defined to connect to intermediary components that ultimately connect to the UA A \u0026 C Server. Using this approach, the A\u0026E COM Client calls co-create instance with a virtual CLSID as described above. This connects to the A\u0026E COM UA Proxy components. The A\u0026E COM UA Proxy then establishes a secure channel and session with the UA A \u0026 C Server. As a result, the A\u0026E COM Client gets a COM Event Server interface pointer."

A MonitoredItem is created for each notifier Node in the sub tree whose relative path matches that of the supplied relative path using established pattern matching rules. An area filter string which contains wildcard characters may result in multiple MonitoredItems added to the UA Subscription. By contrast, an area filter string made up of fully specified path segments and no wildcard characters will result in one MonitoredItem added to the UA Subscription. So, the steps involved are:\nCheck if the filter string contains any of these wild card characters, \u0027*\u0027, \u0027?\u0027, \u0027#\u0027, \u0027[\u0027, \u0027]\u0027, \u0027!\u0027, \u0027-\u0027.\nScan the string for path elements that are completely specified by retrieving the substring up to the last occurrence of the \u0027/\u0027 character.\nObtain the Node Id for this path using TranslateBrowsePathsToNodeIds\nBrowse the Node for all notifiers below it.\nUsing the ComUtils.Match() function match the browse names of these notifiers against the Client supplied string containing the wild card character.\nAdd the Node ids of the notifiers that match as MonitoredItems to the UA Subscription."

If the StateMachine were being applied to a tank or other part of a process it might have a different set of States then if it was applied to a meter or instrument. The meter could only have Operating, OutOfService and Maintenance, while the tank could have all of the described States and Transitions. The transitions are defined in[Table F.22](/\u00A7_Ref28217027).\nThe StateMachine supports six possible states including: Operating, ShuttingDown, StartingUp, Shutdown, OutOfService, Maintenance. It supports 12 possible Transitions and 7 possible Methods.\nTable F. 22 - SystemStateStateMachineType additional references"
