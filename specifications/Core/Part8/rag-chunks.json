When it is a negative number, it specifies the number of insignificant digits to the left of the decimal place.\nFor example a ValuePrecision of -2 specifies that the precision of the Value is to the nearest 100. The ValuePrecision should always be a whole number and it shall always be interpreted as a whole number by rounding it to the nearest whole number.\nFor DateTime values it shall always be a positive number which indicates the minimum time difference in nanoseconds. For example, a ValuePrecision of 20 000 000 defines a precision of 20 ms. The ValuePrecision should always be a whole number and it shall always be interpreted as a whole number by rounding it to the nearest whole number.\nValuePrecision can also be used for other subtypes of Double (like Duration) and other Number subtypes that can be represented by a Double.\nThe ValuePrecision Property is an approximation that is intended to provide guidance to a Client. A Server is expected to silently round any value with more precision that it supports.

If the analog item\u0027s Value contains an array, the Properties shall apply to all elements in the array.\nInstrumentRange defines the value range that can be returned by the instrument.\nEXAMPLE 1: InstrumentRange::= {-9999.9, 9999.9}\nAlthough defined as optional, it is strongly recommended for Servers to support this Property. Without an InstrumentRange being provided, Clients will commonly assume the full range according to the DataType.\nThe InstrumentRange Property can also be used to restrict a Built-in DataType such as Byte or Int16) to a smaller range of values.\nEXAMPLE 2:\nUInt4: InstrumentRange::= {0, 15}\nInt6: InstrumentRange::= {-32, 31}\nThe Range DataType is specified in[5.6.2](/\u00A7_Ref131328551).\nEURange defines the value range likely to be obtained in normal operation. It is intended for such use as automatically scaling a bar graph display.\nSensor or instrument failure or deactivation can result in a returned item value which is actually outside of this range. Client software shall be prepared to deal with this possibility. Similarly a Client can attempt to write a value that is outside of this range back to the server. The exact behaviour (accept, reject, clamp, etc.) in this case is Server-dependent. However, in general Servers shall be prepared to handle this.\nEXAMPLE 3: EURange::= {-200.0,1400.0}\nSee also[7.2](/\u00A7_Ref529348993) for a special monitoring filter ( PercentDeadband) which is based on the engineering unit range."

The y-axis on both sides is marked with a numerical range from 0 to 1. The time-domain graph shows three traces: a red line, a blue line, and a black dashed line. These lines likely represent different signals or data sets being monitored or compared. The frequency-domain graph displays the signal\u0027s spectrum in terms of magnitude and phase angle (not shown). On the right side, there\u0027s another graphical representation that seems to be an oscilloscope view. It shows a single trace in time domain with the x-axis labeled \u0022Time [sec]\u0022 and y-axis labeled \u0022Magnitude.\u0022 The scale on both axes is not fully visible. The image includes a message saying \u0022Magintude response,\u0022 which is probably referring to the amplitude of the signal at different frequencies, as shown in the frequency domain graph. There\u0027s also an arrow pointing from the time-domain graph to the frequency-domain graph, indicating that this view has been generated by selecting the desired trace and switching to a spectral representation. The purpose of these graphs is likely for analyzing data in an industrial context, such as monitoring the performance of a process control system or understanding the behavior of a signal over time and in different frequency bands."

In this diagram, we can see a hierarchical structure of the Address Space model, which includes several nodes connected by lines representing different data items and their relationships. The Address Space is essentially a database or memory space that contains all the variables used in process control systems. Each node represents a variable or group of variables, with properties such as data type, value, and status visible next to them. At the top level, there are nodes labeled \u0022OPC\u0022 and \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 which suggest these might be the top-level containers for all OPC and OPC UA data items respectively. Below this, there is a branching into different categories, such as \u0022Analog,\u0022 \u0022Digital,\u0022 and \u0022Pressure.\u0022 Each of these branches would contain variables related to analog signals (like pressure), digital signals, or other specific types of data relevant to process control systems. The diagram uses icons that represent the type of variable, such as numbers, booleans, and strings, which helps in understanding the structure and data types represented within the Address Space model. The layout provides a visual way for engineers or programmers working with OPC/OPC UA systems to navigate and understand how variables are organized and connected."

Servers that want to disclose similar information should use the OPC-defined Property rather than one that is vendor-specific.\nThe above figure shows only a subset of Attributes and Properties. Other Attributes that are defined for Variables in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3)(e.g., Description) can also be available."

      "Content": "This image depicts an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) which is a type of data diagrams and is commonly used to visually represent the structure of a database from the perspective of the relational model. Here\u0027s a breakdown of what is visible in this figure:- There are three main entities represented: \u0060OPC\u0060, \u0060OPC_UA\u0060, and \u0060Quantity\u0060. These entities likely represent different aspects or components of an OPC (Open Platform Communications) system that uses the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA).- The lines connecting the entities indicate relationships between them. There are two types of relationships shown: \u0060has a\u0060 and \u0060uses\u0060. For example, \u0060OPC_UA has a Quantity\u0060. This indicates that an OPC_UA has one or more instances of the Quantity entity. Similarly, \u0060OPC uses a Quantity\u0060, which suggests that each instance of the OPC entity can be associated with one or more quantities.- The \u0060Quantity\u0060 table appears to have several fields such as \u0060Quantity ID\u0060, \u0060Unit Code\u0060, and \u0060Value\u0060. These are attributes or properties of the quantity entities.- There is a \u0060ServerType\u0060 table with fields like \u0060Server Type ID\u0060 and \u0060Server Name\u0060, which is likely used to classify different types of servers within the system.- The \u0060OPC_UA\u0060 entity has an attribute named \u0060Quantity ID\u0060. This could imply that each instance of the OPC_UA can have a specific quantity associated with it, possibly for monitoring or control purposes.- There is also a database symbol, indicating that this model represents the structure of data within a database used by the system. This type of diagram is useful in software development and database design to understand how different elements interact with each other and what information is being managed."

The diagram shows a series of connected components, each with labels indicating their function or role in the system: 1. \u0022Server Unit\u0022 at the top, which seems to be the central processing unit of the architecture. 2. \u0022OPC Server\u0022 below the Server Unit, which is presumably the component that handles OPC UA communications and protocols. 3. A series of \u0022Data Units\u0022 connected to the OPC Server, each labeled with a unique identifier. These Data Units are likely representing different data points or sets that can be accessed and used by the system. 4. A \u0022Server Unit 2,\u0022 which seems to have a reference to a dictionary named \u0022Dictionary_1.\u0022 5. Below the second Server Unit, there is another unit labeled \u0022Unit 2,\u0022 which has a similar reference to the dictionary as the first one. 6. The bottom part of the diagram includes additional components like \u0022Server Units 3\u0022 and \u00224,\u0022 each with their own unique identifiers and references to a dictionary named \u0022Dictionary_2.\u0022 7. On the right, there are several \u0022Node\u0022 elements connected to the various Server Units, indicating that these nodes can interact or communicate with the server units. 8. At the bottom, there is a reference to a database or data repository called \u0022Database,\u0022 which likely stores and manages the data used by the system. 9. A \u0022Reference_1\u0022 is drawn connecting the second Server Unit to the Database, suggesting that this unit may be referencing data from the database."

Lastly, there are two additional nodes at the bottom right, connected to Unit 4 and Node 4 respectively. Overall, the diagram seems to depict a hierarchical and modular system where various components interact with each other through references to external dictionaries and data sources, specifically OPC and OPC UA standards. The design suggests that this architecture is used for industrial control systems or similar applications where real-time monitoring and control of processes are important."

The COM UA Proxy enables an OPC DA Client to access information from an OPC UA Server.\nThe mappings describe generic DA interoperability components. It is recommended that vendors use this mapping if they develop their own components, however, some applications can benefit from vendor specific mappings."

Here are some popular implementation options:\nAllow browsing the complete COM DA Address Space and then build and persist an offline copy of it. Resolve the BrowseName by scanning this offline copy.\nPro: The ItemID can be used as is for the OPC UA NodeId.\nCon: The initial browse can take a while and can have to be repeated for COM DA Servers with a dynamic Address Space.\nCreate OPC UA NodeId values that include both the COM DA ItemID and the Item name. When the OPC UA Client passes such a NodeId to read the BrowseName or DisplayName Attribute, the wrapper can easily extract the name from the NodeId value.\nPro: Efficient and reliable.\nCon: The NodeId will not represent the ItemId. It becomes difficult for human users to match the two IDs.\nA number of COM DA Servers use ItemIDs that consist of a path where the path elements are separated with a delimiter and the last element is the item name. Wrappers can provide ways to configure the delimiter so that they can easily extract the item name.\nPro: Efficient and reliable. The ItemID can be used as is for the OPC UA NodeId.\nCon: Not a generic solution. Only works for specific COM-DA Servers."

In this figure, there\u0027s a central node labeled \u0022Quality,\u0022 which likely represents the quality of the data being accessed or communicated in an OPC system. From this central point, three branches extend outward: 1. \u0022Status Code\u0022 - This branch likely refers to the different status codes that can be encountered within the OPC UA system. There are four sub-nodes listed under this branch, but their specific details or names are not clear in the image. These could represent different types of status codes related to Quality such as \u0027StatusCode\u0027, \u0027QualityStatus\u0027, \u0027StatusCodeQuality\u0027, etc. 2. \u0022OPC\u0022 - This branch seems to relate to the Open Platform Communications protocol, which is a standard for industrial automation and control systems, allowing diverse systems to be connected and to communicate with one another. There are two sub-nodes under this branch:- \u0022Status Code\u0022 - This node is likely further broken down into specific status codes associated with OPC, such as \u0027OPC_StatusCode\u0027 and \u0027OPC_QualityStatus\u0027. These could represent the quality of data related to OPC operations like read, write, etc.- \u0022Quality\u0022 - This node may refer to the quality parameters or attributes within the OPC context, such as \u0027Quality\u0027, \u0027QualityAttribute\u0027, or \u0027QualityValue\u0027, which are used to assess and communicate the quality of data in an OPC system."

In order to maintain a high degree of consistency and interoperability, it is strongly recommended that vendors, who choose to implement their own version of the Data Access COM UA Proxy, follow these same guidelines and constraints.\nThe Data Access COM Client simply chooses how to connect to the UA Data Access Server. Connectivity approaches include the one where Data Access COM Clients connect to a UA Data Access Server with a CLSID just as if the target Server were a Data Access COM Server. However, the CLSID can be considered virtual since it is defined to connect to intermediary components that ultimately connect to the UA Data Access Server. Using this approach, the Data Access COM Client calls co-create instance with a virtual CLSID as described above. This connects to the Data Access COM UA Proxy components. The Data Access COM UA Proxy then establishes a secure channel and session with the UA Data Access Server. As a result, the Data Access COM Client gets a COM Data Access Server interface pointer."

The main root node, labeled \u0022OPC Address Space,\u0022 is at the top and represents the hierarchical structure of the address space. 2. Below this, there are two nodes representing Variants. These are data types that can contain different kinds of values (scalars, arrays, structures, etc.). 3. Beneath these variants, there are other nodes indicating different attributes or parameters that can be accessed in the address space:- \u0022Variant_1\u0022 is a child node to one of the variant nodes and contains additional information about the data type or value.- \u0022Variant_2\u0022 also has child nodes that represent more specific data within the variant, such as \u0022Scalar_1,\u0022 \u0022Array_1,\u0022 and \u0022Structure_1.\u0022 These child nodes provide further detail on the structure of the data.- There are additional nodes beneath \u0022Structure_1,\u0022 suggesting nested structures or objects within it, but their contents are not fully visible in this image. The color coding might indicate different types of attributes or parameters (e.g., for read-only vs. write-able values). The arrows and lines connecting the nodes represent the relationships between these elements in the address space."

UCUM is able to clearly identify a unit no matter what unit expression is used for it.\nUCUM is a recognized standard in a wide field of applications and is recommended or incorporated by other standards for example the medical field (HL7, DICOM, ISO 11240), or geosciences (WMS, GML)\nUCUM defines\natomic symbols for the 7 base units of the SI / ISQ System\nsymbols for prefixes used with atomic units\na large list of symbols used for named, atomic, non-SI units\na syntax description defining the rules used to combine the defined atomic symbols to express complex units"
