      "Content": "This part of OPC 10000 defines the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Services. The Services defined are the collection of abstract Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that are implemented by OPC UA Servers and called by OPC UA Clients. All interactions between OPC UA Clients and Servers occur via these Services. The defined Services are considered abstract because no particular RPC mechanism for implementation is defined in this document.[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) specifies one or more concrete mappings supported for implementation. For example, one mapping in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) is to UA-TCP UA-SC UA-Binary. In that case the Services described in this document appear as OPC UA Binary encoded payload, secured with OPC UA Secure Conversation and transported via OPC UA TCP.\nNot all OPC UA Servers will need to implement all of the defined Services.[OPC 10000-7](/\u00A7UAPart7) defines the Profiles that dictate which Services need to be implemented in order to be compliant with a particular Profile."

If the receiver is the Client then the Communication Stack should report these errors to the Client application.\nMany applications will place limits on the size of messages and/or data elements contained within these messages. For example, a Server may reject requests containing string values longer than a certain length. These limits are typically set by administrators and apply to all connections between a Client and a Server.\nClients that receive Bad_ EncodingLimitsExceeded faults from the Server will likely need to reformulate their requests. The administrator may need to increase the limits for the Client if it receives a response from the Server with this fault.\nIn some cases, parsing errors are fatal and it is not possible to return a fault. For example, the incoming message could exceed the buffer capacity of the receiver. In these cases, these errors may be treated as a communication fault which requires the SecureChannel to be re-established (see[5.6](/\u00A7_Ref187648579)).\nThe Client and Server reduce the chances of a fatal error by exchanging their message size limits in the CreateSession"

If a Server goes offline then it shall register itself once more and indicate that it is going offline. The period of the recurring registration should be configurable; however, the maximum is 10 minutes. If an error occurs during registration (e.g. the Discovery Server is not running) then the Server shall periodically re-attempt registration. The frequency of these attempts should start at 1 second but gradually increase until the registration frequency is the same as what it would be if no errors occurred. The recommended approach would be to double the period of each attempt until reaching the maximum.\nWhen an automatically launched Server(or its install program) registers with the Discovery Server it shall provide a path to a semaphore file which the Discovery Server can use to determine if the Server has been uninstalled from the machine.

      "Content": "This Service Set defines Services used to open a communication channel that ensures the Confidentiality and Integrity of all Messages exchanged with the Server. The base concepts for OPC UA security are defined in[OPC 10000-2](/\u00A7UAPart2).\nThe SecureChannel Services are unlike other Services because they are not implemented directly by the OPC UA Application. Instead, they are provided by the Communication Stack on which the OPC UA Application is built. For example, an OPC UA Server may be built on a stack that allows applications to establish a SecureChannel using HTTPS. In these cases, the OPC UA Application shall verify that the Message it received was in the context of an HTTPS connection.[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) describes how the SecureChannel Services are implemented.\nA SecureChannel is a long-running logical connection between a single Client and a single Server. This channel maintains a set of keys known only to the Client and Server, which are used to sign and encrypt Messages sent across the network to ensure Confidentiality and Integrity. The SecureChannel Services allow the Client and Server to securely negotiate the keys to use.\nLogical connections may be initiated by the Client or by the Server as described in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6). After the connection is initiated, the SecureChannel is opened and closed by the Client using the SecureChannel Services.\nAn EndpointDescription tells a Client how to establish a SecureChannel with a given Endpoint. A Client may obtain the EndpointDescription from a Discovery Server, via some non-UA defined directory server or from its own configuration.\nThe exact algorithms used to sign and encrypt Messages are described in the SecurityPolicy field of the EndpointDescription. A Client shall use these algorithms when it creates a SecureChannel."

An OPC UA Application shall not process any Message that does not conform to these requirements.\nThe relationship between the SecureChannel and the OPC UA Application depends on the implementation technology.[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6) defines any requirements that depend on the technology used.\nThe correlation between the OPC UA Application Session and the SecureChannel is illustrated in[Figure 13](/\u00A7_Ref130140149). The Communication Stack is used by the OPC UA Applications to exchange Messages. In the first step, the SecureChannel Services are used to establish a SecureChannel between the two Communication Stacks which allows the secure exchange of Messages. In the second step, the OPC UA Applications use the Session Service Set to establish an OPC UA Application Session."

By this we mean that the user identity should be passed to the underlying Server or it should be mapped to an appropriate user identity in the underlying Server. It is unacceptable to ignore user level security. This is required to ensure that security is maintained and that a user does not obtain information that they should not have access to. Whenever possible a Server should impersonate the original Client by passing the original Client\u0027s user identity to the underlying Server when it calls the ActivateSession Service. If impersonation is not an option then the Server shall map the original Client\u0027s user identity onto a new user identity which the underlying Server does recognize."

This Service requires the Communication Stack to apply the various security algorithms to the Messages as they are sent and received. Specific implementations of this Service for different Communication Stacks are described in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6).\nEach SecureChannel has a globally-unique identifier and is valid for a specific combination of Client and Server application instances. Each channel contains one or more SecurityTokens that identify a set of cryptography keys that are used to encrypt and authenticate Messages. SecurityTokens also have globally-unique identifiers which are attached to each Message secured with the token. This allows an authorized receiver to know how to decrypt and verify the Message.\nSecurityTokens have a finite lifetime negotiated with this Service. However, differences between the system clocks on different machines and network latencies mean that valid Messages could arrive after the token has expired. To prevent valid Messages from being discarded, the applications should do the following:\nClients should request a new SecurityToken after 75 % of its lifetime has elapsed. This should ensure that Clients will receive the new SecurityToken before the old one actually expires.\nServers shall use the existing SecurityToken to secure outgoing Messages until the SecurityToken expires or the Server receives a Message secured with a new SecurityToken. This should ensure that Clients do not reject Messages secured with the new SecurityToken that arrive before the Client receives the new SecurityToken.\nClients should accept Messages secured by an expired SecurityToken for up to 25 % of the token lifetime. This should ensure that Messages sent by the Server before the token expired are not rejected because of network delays.\nEach SecureChannel exists until it is explicitly closed or until the last token has expired and the overlap period has elapsed.

The first value is the sessionId which is used to identify the Session in the audit logs and in the Server\u0027s AddressSpace. The second is the authenticationToken which is used to associate an incoming request with a Session.\nBefore calling this Service, the Client shall create a SecureChannel with the OpenSecureChannel Service to ensure the Integrity of all Messages exchanged during a Session. This SecureChannel has a unique identifier which the Server shall associate with the a uthenticationToken. The Server may accept requests with the a uthenticationToken only if they are associated with the same SecureChannel that was used to create the Session. The Client may associate a new SecureChannel with the Session by calling ActivateSession. For the N Sessions supported by a Server, the Server shall support N\u002B1 SecureChannels. A Server may support multiple Sessions for one SecureChannel.\nThe SecureChannel is always managed by the Communication Stack which means it shall provide APIs which the Server can use to find out information about the SecureChannel used for any given request. The Communication Stack shall, at a minimum, provide the SecurityPolicy and SecurityMode used by the SecureChannel. It shall also provide a SecureChannelId which uniquely identifies the SecureChannel or the Client Certificate used to establish the SecureChannel. The Server uses one of these to identify the SecureChannel used to send a request. Clause[7.35](/\u00A7_Ref183363986) describes how to create the a uthenticationToken for different types of Communication Stack.\nDepending upon on the SecurityPolicy and the SecurityMode of the SecureChannel, the exchange of ApplicationInstanceCertificates and Nonces may be optional and the signatures may be empty.

The Client only verifies EndpointDescriptions with a transportProfileUri that matches the profileUri specified in the original GetEndpoints request. A Client may skip this check if the EndpointDescriptions were provided by a trusted source such as the Administrator.\nThe Client shall check that the ApplicationUri specified in the Server Certificate matches the ApplicationUri provided in the EndpointDescription returned by the CreateSession response. If it does not match, the Client shall close the Session.\nThe Server shall check that the ApplicationUri specified in the clientDescription matches the Client Certificate.

See[OPC 10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) for a description of this Variable.\nSessions are created to be independent of the underlying communications connection. Therefore, if a communications connection fails, the Session is not immediately affected. When the communication connection fails, the Client should try to create a new communication connection and call ActivateSession again. See[6.7](/\u00A7_Ref65519698) for more details.\nSessions are terminated by the Server automatically if the Client fails to issue a Service request on the Session within the timeout period negotiated by the Server in the CreateSession Service response. This protects the Server against Client failures and against situations where a failed underlying connection cannot be re-established. Clients shall be prepared to submit requests in a timely manner to prevent the Session from closing automatically. Clients may explicitly terminate Sessions using the CloseSession Service.\nWhen a Session is terminated, all outstanding requests on the Session are aborted and Bad_SessionClosed StatusCodes are returned to the Client. In addition, the Server deletes the entry for the Client from its SessionDiagnosticsArray Variable and notifies any other Clients who were subscribed to this entry.\nIf a Client invokes the CloseSession Service then all Subscriptions associated with the Session are also deleted if the deleteSubscriptions flag is set to TRUE.

In these cases, the Subscription can be reassigned to another Client before its lifetime expires.\nSome Servers, such as aggregating Servers, also act as Clients to other Servers. These Servers typically support more than one system user, acting as their agent to the Servers that they represent. Security for these Servers is supported at two levels.\nFirst, each OPC UA Service request contains a string parameter that is used to carry an audit record id. A Client, or any Server operating as a Client, such as an aggregating Server, can create a local audit log entry for a request that it submits. This parameter allows the Client to pass the identifier for this entry with the request. If the Server also maintains an audit log, then it can include this id in the audit log entry that it writes. When the log is examined and the entry is found, the examiner will be able to relate it directly to the audit log entry created by the Client. This capability allows for traceability across audit logs within a system. See[OPC 10000-2](/\u00A7UAPart2) for additional information on auditing. A Server that maintains an audit log shall provide the information in the audit log entries via event Messages defined in this document. The Server may choose to only provide the Audit information via event Messages. The Audit EventType is defined in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3).\nSecond, these aggregating Servers may open independent Sessions to the underlying Servers for each Client that accesses data from them.[Figure 14](/\u00A7_Ref102967761) illustrates this concept."

This Service request shall be issued by the Client before it issues any Service request other than CloseSession after CreateSession. Failure to do so shall cause the Server to close the Session.\nWhenever the Client calls this Service the Client shall prove that it is the same application that called the CreateSession Service. The Client does this by creating a signature with the private key associated with the clientCertificate specified in the CreateSession request. This signature is created by appending the last serverNonce provided by the Server to the serverCertificate and calculating the signature of the resulting sequence of bytes.\nOnce used, a serverNonce cannot be used again. For that reason, the Server returns a new serverNonce each time the ActivateSession Service is called.\nWhen the ActivateSession Service is called for the first time then the Server shall reject the request if the SecureChannel is not same as the one associated with the CreateSession request. Subsequent calls to ActivateSession may be associated with different SecureChannels. If this is the case then the Server shall verify that the Certificate the Client used to create the new SecureChannel is the same as the Certificate used to create the original SecureChannel. In addition, the Server shall verify that the Client supplied a UserIdentityToken that contains the same ClientUserId as the token currently associated with the Session. Once the Server accepts the new SecureChannel it shall reject requests sent via the old SecureChannel.\nThe ActivateSession Service is used to associate a user identity with a Session. When a Client provides a user identity then it shall provide proof that it is authorized to use that user identity. The exact mechanism used to provide this proof depends on the type of the UserIdentityToken. If the token is a UserNameIdentityToken then the proof is the password"

The data to sign is created by appending the last serverNonce to the serverCertificate specified in the CreateSession response. If a token includes a secret then it should be encrypted using the public key from the serverCertificate.\nServers shall take proper measures to protect against attacks on user identity tokens. Such an attack is assumed if repeated connection attempts with invalid user identity tokens happen. One option is to lock out an OPC UA Client for a period of time if the user identity token validation fails several times. The OPC UA Client is either detected by IP address for unsecured connections or by the ApplicationUri for secured connections. Another option is delaying the Service response when the validation of a user identity fails. This delay time could be increased with repeated failures. Sporadic failures shall not delay connections with valid tokens.\nClients can change the identity of a user associated with a Session by calling the ActivateSession Service. The Server validates the signatures provided with the request and then validates the new user identity. If no errors occur the Server replaces the user identity for the Session. Changing the user identity for a Session may cause discontinuities in active Subscriptions because the Server may need to tear down connections to an underlying system and re-establish them using the new credentials. A Server shall re-evaluate the permissions of all MonitoredItems in Subscriptions assigned to the Session after a user identity change.\nWhen a Client supplies a list of locale ids in the request, each locale id is required to contain the language component.

      "Content": "This Service is used to request that the Server translates one or more browse paths to NodeIds. Each browse path is constructed of a starting Node and a RelativePath. The specified starting Node identifies the Node from which the RelativePath is based. The RelativePath contains a sequence of ReferenceTypes and BrowseNames.\nOne purpose of this Service is to allow programming against type definitions. Since BrowseNames shall be unique in the context of type definitions, a Client may create a browse path that is valid for a type definition and use this path on instances of the type. For example, an ObjectType\u0022Boiler\u0022 may have a \u0022HeatSensor\u0022 Variable as InstanceDeclaration. A graphical element programmed against the \u0022Boiler\u0022 may need to display the Value of the \u0022HeatSensor\u0022. If the graphical element would be called on \u0022Boiler1\u0022, an instance of \u0022Boiler\u0022, it would need to call this Service specifying the NodeId of \u0022Boiler1\u0022 as starting Node and the BrowseName of the \u0022HeatSensor\u0022 as browse path. The Service would return the NodeId of the \u0022HeatSensor\u0022 of \u0022Boiler1\u0022 and the graphical element could subscribe to its Value Attribute.\nIf a Node has multiple targets with the same BrowseName, the Server shall return a list of NodeIds. However, since one of the main purposes of this Service is to support programming against type definitions, the NodeId of the Node based on the type definition of the starting Node is returned as the first NodeId in the list."

The RegisterNodes Service can be used by Clients to register the Nodes that they know they will access repeatedly (e.g. Write, Call). It allows Servers to set up anything needed so that the access operations will be more efficient. Clients can expect performance improvements when using registered NodeIds, but the optimization measures are vendor-specific. For Variable Nodes Servers shall concentrate their optimization efforts on the Value Attribute.\nRegistered NodeIds are only guaranteed to be valid within the current Session. Clients shall unregister unneeded Ids immediately to free up resources.\nRegisterNodes does not validate the NodeIds from the request. Servers will simply copy unknown NodeIds in the response. Structural NodeId errors (size violations, invalid id types) will cause the complete Service to fail.\nFor the purpose of Auditing, Servers shall not use the registered NodeIds but only the canonical NodeIds which is the value of the NodeId Attribute."

The age of the value is based on the difference between the ServerTimestamp and the time when the Server starts processing the request.

The number of values of an Attribute that a Server has depends on the number of MonitoredItems that are defined for the Attribute.

      "Content": "This Service is used to read historical values or Events of one or more Nodes. For constructed Attribute values whose elements are indexed, such as an array, this Service allows Clients to read the entire set of indexed values as a composite, to read individual elements or to read ranges of elements of the composite. Servers may make historical values available to Clients using this Service, although the historical values themselves are not visible in the AddressSpace.\nThe AccessLevel Attribute defined in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3) indicates a Node\u0027s support for historical values. Several request parameters indicate how the Server is to access values from the underlying history data source. The EventNotifier Attribute defined in[OPC 10000-3](/\u00A7UAPart3) indicates a Node\u0027s support for historical Events.\nThe continuationPoint parameter in the HistoryRead is used to mark a point from which to continue the read if not all values could be returned in one response. The value is opaque for the Client and is only used to maintain the state information for the Server to continue from. A Server may use the timestamp of the last returned data item if the timestamp is unique. This can reduce the need in the Server to store state information for the continuation point.\nIn some cases it may take longer than the Client timeout hint to read the data for all nodes to read. Then the Server may return zero results with a continuation point for the affected nodes before the timeout expires. That allows the Server to resume the data acquisition on the next Client read call.\nFor additional details on reading historical data and historical Events see[OPC 10000-11](/\u00A7UAPart11)."

      "Content": "This Service is used to write values to one or more Attributes of one or more Nodes. For constructed Attribute values whose elements are indexed, such as an array, this Service allows Clients to write the entire set of indexed values as a composite, to write individual elements or to write ranges of elements of the composite.\nThe values are written to the data source, such as a device, and the Service does not return until it writes the values or determines that the value cannot be written. In certain cases, the Server will successfully write to an intermediate system or Server, and will not know if the data source was updated properly. In these cases, the Server should report a success code that indicates that the write was not verified. In the cases where the Server is able to verify that it has successfully written to the data source, it reports an unconditional success.\nThe order the operations are processed in the Server is not defined and depends on the different data sources and the internal Server logic. If an Attribute and Node combination is contained in more than one operation, the order of the processing is undefined. If a Client requires sequential processing the Client needs separate Service calls.\nIt is possible that the Server may successfully write some Attributes, but not others. Rollback is the responsibility of the Client.\nIf a Server allows writing of Attributes with the DataType LocalizedText, the Client can add or overwrite the text for a locale by writing the text with the associated LocaleId. Writing a null String for the text for a locale shall delete the String for that locale. Writing a null String for the locale and a non-null String for the text is setting the text for an invariant locale. Writing a null String for the text and a null String for the locale shall delete the entries for all locales.

An exception-based model means that the underlying system does not require sampling and reports data changes.\nThe Client may use the revised sampling interval values as a hint for setting the publishing interval as well as the keep-alive count of a Subscription. If, for example, the smallest revised sampling interval of the MonitoredItems is 5 seconds, then the time before a keep-alive is sent should be longer than 5 seconds.\nNote that, in many cases, the OPC UA Server provides access to a decoupled system and therefore has no knowledge of the data update logic. In this case, even though the OPC UA Server samples at the negotiated rate, the data might be updated by the underlying system at a much slower rate.

The discard policy is ignored if the queue size is one.\nOn the other hand, the Client may want to subscribe to a continuous stream of Notifications without any gaps, but does not want them reported at the sampling interval. In this case, the MonitoredItem would be created with a queue size large enough to hold all Notifications generated between two consecutive publishing cycles. Then, at each publishing cycle, the Subscription would send all Notifications queued for the MonitoredItem to the Client. The Server shall return Notifications for any particular item in the same order they are in the queue.\nThe Server may be sampling at a faster rate than the sampling interval to support other Clients; the Client should only expect values at the negotiated sampling interval.

Their precise behaviour is described in[5.14.1.2](/\u00A7_Ref107033922).\nSubscriptions have a set of MonitoredItems assigned to them by the Client. MonitoredItems generate Notifications that are to be reported to the Client by the Subscription(see[5.13.1](/\u00A7_Ref110831567) for a description of MonitoredItems).\nSubscriptions have a publishing interval. The publishing interval of a Subscription defines the cyclic rate at which the Subscription executes. Each time it executes, it attempts to send a NotificationMessage to the Client. NotificationMessages contain Notifications that have not yet been reported to Client.\nNotificationMessages are sent to the Client in response to Publish requests. Publish requests are normally queued to the Session as they are received, and one is de-queued and processed by a Subscription related to this Session for each publishing cycle, if there are Notifications to report. When there are not, the Publish request is not de-queued from the Session, and the Server waits until the next cycle and checks again for Notifications.\nAt the beginning of a cycle, if there are Notifications to send but there are no Publish requests queued, the Server enters a wait state for a Publish request to be received. When one is received, it is processed immediately without waiting for the next publishing cycle.\nNotificationMessages are uniquely identified by sequence numbers that enable Clients to detect missed Messages. The publishing interval also defines the default sampling interval for its MonitoredItems.\nSubscriptions have a keep-alive counter that counts the number of consecutive publishing cycles in which there have been no Notifications to report to the Client. When the maximum keep-alive count is reached, a Publish"

      "Content": "Publish request is de-queued and used to return a keep-alive Message. This keep-alive Message informs the Client that the Subscription is still active. Each keep-alive Message is a response to a Publish request in which the notificationMessage parameter does not contain any Notifications and that contains the sequence number of the next NotificationMessage that is to be sent. In the clauses that follow, the term NotificationMessage refers to a response to a Publish request in which the notificationMessage parameter actually contains one or more Notifications, as opposed to a keep-alive Message in which this parameter contains no Notifications. The maximum keep-alive count is set by the Client during Subscription creation and may be subsequently modified using the ModifySubscription Service. Similar to Notification processing described in (c) above, if there are no Publish requests queued, the Server waits for the next one to be received and sends the keep-alive immediately without waiting for the next publishing cycle.\nPublishing by a Subscription may be enabled or disabled by the Client when created, or subsequently using the SetPublishingMode Service. Disabling causes the Subscription to cease sending NotificationMessages to the Client. However, the Subscription continues to execute cyclically and continues to send keep-alive Messages to the Client.\nSubscriptions have a lifetime counter that counts the number of consecutive publishing cycles in which there have been no Publish requests available to send a Publish response for the Subscription. Any Service call that uses the SubscriptionId or the processing of a Publish response resets the lifetime counter of this Subscription. When this counter reaches the value calculated for the lifetime of a Subscription, the Subscription is closed. Closing the Subscription causes its MonitoredItems to be deleted.

Clients are required to acknowledge NotificationMessages as they are received if the Publish response parameter availableSequenceNumbers is not an empty array. An empty array in availableSequenceNumbers indicates that the Server does not support a retransmission queue and acknowledgement of NotificationMessages. In the case of a retransmission queue overflow, the oldest sent NotificationMessage gets deleted. If a Subscription is transferred to another Session, the queued NotificationMessages for this Subscription are moved from the old to the new Session.\nThe sequence number is an unsigned 32-bit integer that is incremented by one for each NotificationMessage sent. The value 0 is never used for the sequence number. The first NotificationMessage sent on a Subscription has a sequence number of 1. If the sequence number rolls over, it rolls over to 1.\nWhen a Subscription is created, the first Message is sent at the end of the first publishing cycle to inform the Client that the Subscription is operational. A NotificationMessage is sent if there are Notifications ready to be reported. If there are none, a keep-alive Message is sent instead that contains a sequence number of 1, indicating that the first NotificationMessage"

This is the only time a keep-alive Message is sent without waiting for the maximum keep-alive count to be reached, as specified in (f) above.\nA Client shall be prepared for receiving Publish responses for a Subscription more frequently than the corresponding publishing interval. One example is the situation where the number of available notifications exceeds the Subscription setting maxNotificationsPerPublish. A Client is always able to control the timing of the Publish responses by not queueing Publish requests. If a Client does not queue Publish requests in the Server, the Server can only send a Publish response if it receives a new Publish request. This would increase latency for delivery of notifications but allows a Client to throttle the number of received Publish responses in high load situations.\nThe value of the sequence number is never reset during the lifetime of a Subscription. Therefore, the same sequence number shall not be reused on a Subscription until over four billion NotificationMessages have been sent. At a continuous rate of one thousand NotificationMessages per second on a given Subscription, it would take roughly fifty days for the same sequence number to be reused. This allows Clients to safely treat sequence numbers as unique.\nSequence numbers are also used by Clients to acknowledge the receipt of NotificationMessages. Publish requests allow the Client to acknowledge all Notifications up to a specific sequence number and to acknowledge the sequence number of the last NotificationMessage received. One or more gaps may exist in between. Acknowledgements allow the Server to delete NotificationMessages from its retransmission queue. If the retransmission queue contains outdated sequence numbers related to the sequence number acknowledged by the Client, the Server may delete these older NotificationMessage from the retransmission queue. The outdated sequence numbers are calculated with the following formular.\noutdated \u003C acknowledged sequence number - (2 x max retransmission queue size)\nClients"

This description applies when publishing is enabled or disabled for the Subscription.\nAfter creation of the Subscription, the Server starts the publishing timer and restarts it whenever it expires. If the timer expires the number of times defined for the Subscription lifetime without having received a Subscription Service request from the Client, the Subscription assumes that the Client is no longer present, and terminates.\nClients send Publish requests to Servers to receive Notifications. Publish requests are not directed to any one Subscription and, therefore, may be used by any Subscription. Each contains acknowledgements for one or more Subscriptions. These acknowledgements are processed when the Publish request is received. The Server then queues the request in a queue shared by all Subscriptions, except in the following cases.\nThe previous Publish response indicated that there were still more Notifications ready to be transferred and there were no more Publish requests queued to transfer them.\nThe publishing timer of a Subscription expired and there were either Notifications to be sent or a keep-alive Message to be sent.\nIn these cases, the newly received Publish request is processed immediately by the first Subscription to encounter either case (a) or case (b).\nEach time the publishing timer expires, it is immediately reset. If there are Notifications or a keep-alive Message to be sent, it de-queues and processes a Publish request. When a Subscription processes a Publish request, it accesses the queues of its MonitoredItems and de-queues its Notifications, if any. It returns these Notifications in the response, setting the moreNotifications flag if it was not able to return all available Notifications in the response.\nIf there were Notifications or a keep-alive Message to be sent but there were no Publish requests queued, the Subscription assumes that the Publish"

If one or more Notifications have been generated, a Publish request is de-queued and a NotificationMessage is returned in the response. However, if the publishing timer expires without a Notification becoming available, a Publish request is de-queued and a keep-alive Message is returned in the response. The Subscription then returns to the normal state of waiting for the publishing timer to expire again.

      "Content": "This Service is used for two purposes. First, it is used to acknowledge the receipt of NotificationMessages for one or more Subscriptions. Second, it is used to request the Server to return a NotificationMessage or a keep-alive Message. Since Publish requests are not directed to a specific Subscription, they may be used by any Subscription.[5.14.1.2](/\u00A7_Ref107033922) describes the use of the Publish Service.\nClient strategies for issuing Publish requests may vary depending on the networking delays between the Client and the Server. In many cases, the Client may wish to issue a Publish request immediately after creating a Subscription, and thereafter, immediately after receiving a Publish response.\nIn other cases, especially in high latency networks, the Client may wish to pipeline Publish requests to ensure cyclic reporting from the Server. Pipelining involves sending more than one Publish request for each Subscription before receiving a response. For example, if the network introduces a delay between the Client and the Server of 5 seconds and the publishing interval for a Subscription is one second, then the Client shall issue Publish requests every second instead of waiting for a response to be received before sending the next request.\nA Server should limit the number of active Publish requests to avoid an infinite number since it is expected that the Publish requests are queued in the Server. But a Server shall accept more queued Publish requests than created Subscriptions. It is expected that a Server supports several Publish requests per Subscription. When a Server receives a new Publish request that exceeds its limit it shall de-queue the oldest Publish request and return a response with the result set to Bad_ TooManyPublishRequests. If a Client receives this Service result for a Publish request it shall not issue another Publish request before one of its outstanding Publish requests is returned from the Server.\nClients can limit the size of Publish"

If either situation occurs then the Client will adjust its message processing limits or the parameters for the Subscription and/or MonitoredItems.\nThe return diagnostic info setting in the request header of the CreateMonitoredItems or the last ModifyMonitoredItems Service is applied to the Monitored Items and is used as the diagnostic information settings when sending Notifications in the Publish response."

The Global Discovery Server (GDS) and CertificateManager functionality is defined in[OPC 10000-12](/\u00A7UAPart12).\nIf the Administrator decides that a self-signed Certificate meets the security requirements for the organization, then the Administrator may skip Steps 3 through 5. Application vendors shall ensure that a Certificate is available after the installation process. Every OPC UA Application shall allow the Administrators to replace ApplicationInstanceCertificates with Certificates that meet their requirements.\nWhen the Administrator requests a new Certificate from a Certificate Authority, the Certificate Authority may require that the Administrator provide proof of authorization to request Certificates for the organization that will own the Certificate.

There are two separate lists: a list of trusted Certificates and a list of issuer Certificates(i.e. CAs).

The list of issuer Certificates contains CA Certificates needed for chain validation that are not in the list of trusted Certificates.\nWhen building a chain each Certificate in the chain shall be validated back to a CA with a self-signed Certificate(a.k.a. a root CA). If any validation error occurs then the trust check fails. Some validation errors are non-critical which means they can be suppressed by a user of an Application with the appropriate privileges.

These Certificates may be stored locally or they may be provided with the application Certificate. Processing fails with Bad_SecurityChecksFailed if an element in the chain cannot be found.

The figure shows only one CA, however, there is no requirement that the Client and Server Certificates be issued by the same authority. A self-signed ApplicationInstanceCertificate does not need to be verified with a CA. Any Certificate shall be rejected if it is not in a TrustList provided by the administrator.\nBoth the Client and Server shall have a list of Certificates that they have been configured to trust (sometimes called the Certificate Trust List or CTL). These trusted Certificates may be Certificates for Certificate Authorities or they may be OPC UA ApplicationInstanceCertificates. OPC UA Applications shall be configured to reject connections with applications that do not have a trusted Certificate.\nCertificates can be compromised, which means they should no longer be trusted. Administrators can revoke a Certificate by removing it from the TrustList for all applications or the CA can add the Certificate to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for the Issuer Certificate. Administrators may save a local copy of the CRL for each Issuer Certificate when online access is not available.\nA Client does not need to call GetEndpoints each time it connects to the Server. This information should change rarely and the Client can cache it locally. If the Server rejects the OpenSecureChannel request the Client should call GetEndpoints and make sure the Server configuration has not changed.\nThere are two security risks which a Client shall be aware of when using the GetEndpoints Service. The first could come from a rogue Discovery Server that tries to direct the Client to a rogue Server"

The Client protects itself against this by comparing the list of EndpointDescriptions returned from the GetEndpoints Service with list returned in the CreateSession response.\nThe exact mechanisms for using the SecurityToken to sign and encrypt Messages exchanged over the SecureChannel are described in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6). The process for renewing tokens is also described in detail in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6).\nIn many cases, the Certificates used to establish the SecureChannel will be the ApplicationInstanceCertificates. However, some Communication Stacks might not support Certificates that are specific to a single application. Instead, they expect all communication to be secured with a Certificate specific to a user or the entire machine. For this reason, OPC UA Applications will need to exchange their ApplicationInstanceCertificates when creating a Session."

These Authorization Services act in concert with an external identity provider which validates the user credentials before the external Authorization Service creates an Access Token that tells the Server what the user is a allowed to do. The Client interactions with these services may be indirect as shown in[6.2.2](/\u00A7_Ref494296474) or direct as shown in[6.2.3](/\u00A7_Ref494296484).\nEven when the Server requires the Client to use an external Authorization Service the Server is still responsible for managing and enforcing the Permissions assigned to Nodes in its Address Space.

If Session-less Service invocation is supported by a Server, all Services belonging to these Service Sets that are supported by a Server via a Session shall also be supported via the SessionlessInvoke Service.\nSession-less Services are invoked via a SecureChannel using the Access Token returned from the Authorization Service as the authenticationToken in the requestHeader. The SecureChannel shall have encryption enabled to prevent eavesdroppers from seeing the Access Token. The Access Token provides the user authentication. If application authentication through the SecureChannel is sufficient, Servers may not require the Access Token and assume an anonymous user.

This load includes even simple connections attempts or monitoring of the ServiceLevel. The EstimatedReturnTime indicates when the Client should check to see if the Server is available. If updates or patches are taking longer than expected the Client may discover that the EstimatedReturnTime has been extended further into the future. If the Server does not provide the EstimatedReturnTime, or if the time has lapsed, the Client should use a much longer interval between reconnects to a Server in the Maintenance sub-range than its normal reconnect interval.\n1-1\nNoData\nThe Failed Server is not operational.

This may mean that redundant Servers are unavailable (not powered up) or are available but not running (PC is running, but application is not started)\nWarm\nWarm Failover mode is where the backup Server(s) can be active, but is not operating in a mode which delivers the same level of functionality available from the primary Server. For example it cannot connect to actual data points (typically, a system where the underlying devices are limited to a single connection). Underlying devices, such as PLCs, may have limited resources that permit a single Server connection. Therefore, only a single Server will be able to consume data.

In scenarios where Servers acquire data from a downstream device, such as a PLC, then one or more Servers are actively connected to the downstream device(s) in parallel. These Servers have minimal knowledge of the other Servers in their group and are independently functioning. When a Server fails or encounters a serious problem then its ServiceLevel drops.

Upon detection of an active Client failure, a backup Client would then instruct the Server to transfer the Subscriptions to its own session. If the Subscription is crafted carefully, with sufficient resources to buffer data during the change-over, data loss from a Client Failover can be prevented.\nOPC UA does not provide a standardized mechanism for conveying the SessionId and SubscriptionIds from the active Client to the backup Clients, but as long as the backup Clients know the Client name of the active Client, this information is readily available using the SessionDiagnostics and SubscriptionDiagnostics portions of the ServerDiagnostics data. This information is available for authorized users and for the user active on the Session. TransferSubscriptions requires the same user on all redundant Clients to succeed."

See[OPC 10000-13](/\u00A7UaPart13) for details on possible Aggregate functions. It specifies a startTime of the first Aggregate to be calculated. The samplingInterval of the MonitoringParameters(see[7.21](/\u00A7_Ref161114771)) defines how the Server should internally sample the underlying data source. The processingInterval specifies the size of a time-period where the Aggregate is calculated. The queueSize from the MonitoringAttributes specifies the number of processed values that should be kept.\nThe intention of the AggregateFilter is not to read historical data, the HistoryRead service should be used for this purpose. However, it is allowed that the startTime is set to a time that is in the past when received from the Server. The number of Aggregates to be calculated in the past should not exceed the queueSize defined in the MonitoringAttributes since the values exceeding the queueSize would directly be discharged and never returned to the Client.\nThe startTime and the processingInterval can be revised by the Server, but the startTime should remain in the same boundary (startTime \u002B revisedProcessingInterval * n = revisedStartTime). That behaviour simplifies accessing historical values of the Aggregates using the same boundaries by calling the HistoryRead service. The extensible Parameter AggregateFilterResult is used to return the revised values for the AggregateFilter.\nSome underlying systems may poll data and produce multiple samples with the same value. Other systems may only report changes to the values.

The Client then sends this value with every request which allows the Server to verify that the sender of the request is the same as the sender of the original CreateSession request.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, a Server consists of application (code) and a Communication Stack as shown in[Figure 37](/\u00A7_Ref185171717). The security provided by the SessionAuthenticationToken depends on a trust relationship between the Server application and the Communication Stack. The Communication Stack shall be able to verify the sender of the message and it uses the SecureChannelId or the Client Certificate to identify the sender to the Server.

      "Content": "This deprecated Service Set is used to issue a Query to a Server. OPC UA Query is generic in that it provides an underlying storage mechanism independent Query capability that can be used to access a wide variety of OPC UA data stores and information management systems. OPC UA Query permits a Client to access data maintained by a Server without any knowledge of the logical schema used for internal storage of the data. Knowledge of the AddressSpace is sufficient.\nAn OPC UA Application is expected to use the OPC UA Query Services as part of an initialization process or an occasional information synchronization step. For example, OPC UA Query would be used for bulk data access of a persistent store to initialise an analysis application with the current state of a system configuration. A Query may also be used to initialise or populate data for a report.\nA Query defines what instances of one or more TypeDefinitionNodes in the AddressSpace should supply a set of Attributes. Results returned by a Server are in the form of an array of QueryDataSets. The selected Attribute values in each QueryDataSet come from the definition of the selected TypeDefinitionNodes or related TypeDefinitionNodes and appear in results in the same order as the Attributes that were passed into the Query. Query also supports Node filtering on the basis of Attribute values, as well as relationships between TypeDefinitionNodes."

See[OPC 10000-5](/\u00A7UAPart5) for a description of the organization of Views in the AddressSpace.\nFor any existing View, a Query may be used to return a subset of data from the View. When an application issues a Query against a View, only data defined by the View is returned. Data not included in the View but included in the original AddressSpace is not returned.\nThe Query Services supports access to current and historical data. The Service supports a Client querying a past version of the AddressSpace. Clients may specify a ViewVersion or a Timestamp in a Query to access past versions of the AddressSpace. OPC UA Query is complementary to Historical Access in that the former is used to Query an AddressSpace that existed at a time and the latter is used to Query for the value of Attributes over time. In this way, a Query can be used to retrieve a portion of a past AddressSpace so that Attribute value history may be accessed using Historical Access even if the Node is no longer in the current AddressSpace.\nServers that support Query are expected to be able to access the AddressSpace that is associated with the local Server and any Views that are available on the local Server. If a View or the AddressSpace also references a remote Server, query may be able to access the AddressSpace of the remote Server, but it is not required. If a Server does access a remote Server the access is accomplished using the user identity of the Client as described in[5.6.1](/\u00A7_Ref151214290)."

      "Content": "This Service is used to issue a Query request to the Server. The complexity of the Query can range from very simple to highly sophisticated. The Query can simply request data from instances of a TypeDefinitionNode or TypeDefinitionNode subject to restrictions specified by the filter. On the other hand, the Query can request data from instances of related Node types by specifying a RelativePath from an originating TypeDefinitionNode. In the filter, a separate set of paths can be constructed for limiting the instances that supply data. A filtering path can include multiple RelatedTo operators to define a multi-hop path between source instances and target instances. For example, one could filter on students that attend a particular school, but return information about students and their families. In this case, the student school relationship is traversed for filtering, but the student family relationship is traversed to select data. For a complete description of ContentFilter see[7.7](/\u00A7_Ref132019059), also see Clause[B.1](/\u00A7_Ref188668154) for simple examples and Clause[B.2](/\u00A7_Ref188668219) for more complex examples of content filter and queries.\nThe Client provides an array of NodeTypeDescription which specify the NodeId of a TypeDefinitionNode and selects what Attributes are to be returned in the response. A Client can also provide a set of RelativePaths through the type system starting from an originating TypeDefinitionNode. Using these paths, the Client selects a set of Attributes from Nodes that are related to instances of the originating TypeDefinitionNode. Additionally, the Client can request the Server return instances of subtypes of TypeDefinitionNodes. If a selected Attribute does not exist in a TypeDefinitionNode but does exist in a subtype, it is assumed to have a null value in the TypeDefinitionNode"

      "Content": "TypeDefinitionNode in question. Therefore, this does not constitute an error condition and a null value is returned for the Attribute.\nThe Client can use the filter parameter to limit the result set by restricting Attributes and Properties to certain values. Another way the Client can use a filter to limit the result set is by specifying how instances should be related, using RelatedTo operators. In this case, if an instance at the top of the RelatedTo path cannot be followed to the bottom of the path via specified hops, no QueryDataSets are returned for the starting instance or any of the intermediate instances.\nWhen querying for related instances in the RelativePath, the Client can optionally ask for References. A Reference is requested via a RelativePath that only includes a ReferenceType. If all References are desired than the root ReferenceType is listed. These References are returned as part of the QueryDataSets.\nQuery Services allow a special handling of the targetName field in the RelativePath. In several Query use cases a type NodeId is necessary in the path instead of a QualifiedName. Therefore the Client is allowed to specify a NodeId in the QualifiedName. This is done by setting the namespaceIndex of the targetName to zero and the name part of the targetName to the XML representation of the NodeId. The XML representation is defined in[OPC 10000-6](/\u00A7UAPart6). When matching instances are returned as the target node, the target node should be an instance of the specified type or subtype of the specified type.\n[Table B.3](/\u00A7_Ref136942240) defines the request parameters and[Table B.4](/\u00A7_Ref136942241) the response parameters for the QueryFirst Service.\nTable B. 3 - QueryFirst Request Parameters"
