There are two ways to determine Bounding Values for an interval. One way (called Interpolated Bounding Values) uses the first non-Bad data points found before and after the timestamp to estimate the bound. The other (called Simple Bounding Values) uses the data points immediately before and after the boundary timestamps to estimate the bound even if these points are Bad. Subclauses[3.1.8](/\u00A7_Ref364944818) and[3.1.9](/\u00A7_Ref364944831) describe the two different approaches in more detail.\nIn all cases the TreatUncertainAsBad(see[4.2.1.2](/\u00A7_Ref246227644)) flag is used to determine whether Uncertain values are Bad or non-Bad.\nIf a Raw value was not found and a non-Bad bounding value exists the Aggregate Bits (see[5.3.3](/\u00A7_Ref271578020)) are set to \u0027Interpolated\u0027.\nWhen calculating bounding values, the value portion of Raw data that has Bad status is set to null. This means the value portion is not used in any calculation and a null is returned if the raw value is returned. The status portion is determined by the rules specified by the bound or Aggregate.\nThe Interpolated Bounding Values approach (see[3.1.8](/\u00A7_Ref364944818)) is the same as what is used in Classic OPC Historical Data Access (HDA) and is important for applications such as advanced process control where having useful values at all times is important.

Note that the value is still treated as Uncertain when the StatusCode for the result is calculated.\nThe PercentDataBad Variable indicates the minimum percentage of Bad data in a given interval required for the StatusCode for the given interval for processed data request to be set to Bad. ( Uncertain is treated as defined above.) Refer to[5.4.3](/\u00A7_Ref143529325) for details on using this Variable when assigning StatusCodes. For details on which Aggregates use the PercentDataBad Variable, see the definition of each Aggregate. The default value is 100.\nThe PercentDataGood Variable indicates the minimum percentage of Good data in a given interval required for the StatusCode for the given interval for the processed data requests to be set to Good. Refer to[5.4.3](/\u00A7_Ref143529325) for details on using this Variable when assigning StatusCodes. For details on which Aggregates use the PercentDataGood Variable, see the definition of each Aggregate. The default value is 100.\nThe following calculations are used to detemine the StatusCode which will be used to calculate the value of the aggregate.  Refer to 5.4.3 for details on using these Variables when assigning StatusCodes. The PercentDataGood and PercentDataBad shall follow the following relationship PercentDataGood \u2265 (100 - PercentDataBad). If they are equal the result of the PercentDataGood"

This model likely relates to the configuration of functions and capabilities within this framework. The diagram consists of several nodes or components connected by arrows, suggesting a flow or process. At the top left, there is a main node labeled \u0022OPC,\u0022 which indicates the starting point or root of the structure. From the OPC node, three child nodes emerge: \u0022Aggregates,\u0022 \u0022Operations,\u0022 and \u0022Configurations.\u0022 These represent the core components that are part of the aggregation functionality within this system. The \u0022Aggregates\u0022 node has two child nodes: \u0022NodeSet\u0022 and \u0022Aggregate Configurations.\u0022 This indicates that there is a relationship between nodesets and aggregate configurations in the model. A \u0022NodeSet\u0022 typically represents a collection of related objects or items within a system, while an \u0022Aggregate Configuration\u0022 pertains to the configuration settings for these aggregates. The \u0022Operations\u0022 node is connected to a child node labeled \u0022Aggregate Operations,\u0022 which implies that each aggregate can have associated operations. These operations are likely to be the actions that can be performed on an aggregate within the system. Below the \u0022Aggregate Configurations\u0022 node, there\u0027s another child node titled \u0022Aggregate Functions.\u0022 This suggests that aggregates can have functions associated with them, which may represent the capabilities or features of the aggregates. The \u0022Configurations\u0022 node is connected to a subnode labeled \u0022Aggregate Functions,\u0022 which mirrors the concept from the \u0022Aggregate Operations\u0022 node. The presence of both operations and functions in separate nodes could imply that they are distinct entities, with functions being more specific than operations."

Additionally, there are two nodes representing different types of configurations: \u0022Aggregate Configurations\u0022 and \u0022Configuration Data.\u0022 The configuration data likely pertains to specific details or settings within the aggregate configuration.

In addition, the configuration parameters PercentDataGood and PercentDataBad allow the client to control how this calculation is done if supported by the Server.\nIf an Aggregate operates on raw values (e.g. Average) the calculation is done by counting values. If an Aggregate operates on raw values but can also return a Bounding Value then the Bounding Values are included in the count when computing the StatusCode. If an Aggregate does any sort of a time weighted calculation (e.g. TimeAverage or TimeAverage2) then the StatusCode calculation shall also be time weighted.\nFor purposes of calculating time weighted StatusCodes each interval shall be divided into regions of Good or Bad data. Creating these regions requires that the bounding values be calculated for each interval and the type of bounding value depends on the Aggregate.\nUse the following to determine the StatusCode of a given aggregate. If TreatUncertainAsBad = False then Uncertain regions are included with the Good regions when calculating the above ratios, if the TreatUncertainAsBad = True then the Uncertain regions are included as Bad regions. If no Bad regions are in the interval then the StatusCode for the interval is Good. For any intervals containing regions where the StatusCodes are Bad, the total duration of all Bad regions is calculated and divided by the width of the interval. The resulting ratio is multiplied by 100 and compared to the PercentDataBad parameter. The StatusCode for the interval is Bad if the ratio is greater than or equal to the PercentDataBad parameter. For any interval which is not Bad, the total duration of all Good regions is then calculated and divided by the width of the interval.

If a sub-interval ends at a Bad value then only the Good starting value is used to calculate the area of sub-interval preceding the Bad value.\nThe Aggregate StatusCode will be determined using the StatusCode Calculation (see[5.3](/\u00A7_Ref364945198)).\nTable 18 - TimeAverage2 Aggregate summary"

This particular chart is titled \u0022StandardDeviationSample\u0022 and seems to relate to \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 which stands for OPC Unified Architecture, a standard for industrial automation and interoperability. The chart features a graph with one line that represents the standard deviation of a dataset over time. The x-axis (horizontal) is labeled \u0022x\u0022 but does not have specific numerical values, suggesting that it represents some form of continuous variable like time or another independent variable. The y-axis (vertical) is labeled \u0022\u03C3,\u0022 which stands for the Greek letter sigma and commonly denotes the standard deviation in statistics. On the graph, there\u0027s a vertical dashed line with a label \u0022\u03C3_avg\u0022 at the x-coordinate of 1, indicating the average value of the dataset over time. The line itself shows fluctuations that correspond to the standard deviation of the data points at each time or index point on the x-axis. Below the graph, there\u0027s a formula written in mathematical notation: \u03C3_avg = \u221A(\u2211[(x_i - x_avg)^2 / n) This equation represents the calculation for the sample average of the data points (\u03C3_avg), where \u0022x_i\u0022 represents each individual data point, \u0022x_avg\u0022 is the average value, and \u0022n\u0022 is the number of data points. The \u221A symbol denotes the square root function."

The histogram has a grid on the y-axis representing frequency and a bar for each observed value on the x-axis.

However, without additional information, it is not clear what these acronyms stand for.
