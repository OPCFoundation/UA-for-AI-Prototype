There are two ways to determine Bounding Values for an interval. One way (called Interpolated Bounding Values) uses the first non-Bad data points found before and after the timestamp to estimate the bound. The other (called Simple Bounding Values) uses the data points immediately before and after the boundary timestamps to estimate the bound even if these points are Bad. Subclauses[3.1.8](/\u00A7_Ref364944818) and[3.1.9](/\u00A7_Ref364944831) describe the two different approaches in more detail.\nIn all cases the TreatUncertainAsBad(see[4.2.1.2](/\u00A7_Ref246227644)) flag is used to determine whether Uncertain values are Bad or non-Bad.\nIf a Raw value was not found and a non-Bad bounding value exists the Aggregate Bits (see[5.3.3](/\u00A7_Ref271578020)) are set to \u0027Interpolated\u0027.\nWhen calculating bounding values, the value portion of Raw data that has Bad status is set to null. This means the value portion is not used in any calculation and a null is returned if the raw value is returned. The status portion is determined by the rules specified by the bound or Aggregate.\nThe Interpolated Bounding Values approach (see[3.1.8](/\u00A7_Ref364944818)) is the same as what is used in Classic OPC Historical Data Access (HDA) and is important for applications such as advanced process control where having useful values at all times is important.

This model likely relates to the configuration of functions and capabilities within this framework. The diagram consists of several nodes or components connected by arrows, suggesting a flow or process. At the top left, there is a main node labeled \u0022OPC,\u0022 which indicates the starting point or root of the structure. From the OPC node, three child nodes emerge: \u0022Aggregates,\u0022 \u0022Operations,\u0022 and \u0022Configurations.\u0022 These represent the core components that are part of the aggregation functionality within this system. The \u0022Aggregates\u0022 node has two child nodes: \u0022NodeSet\u0022 and \u0022Aggregate Configurations.\u0022 This indicates that there is a relationship between nodesets and aggregate configurations in the model. A \u0022NodeSet\u0022 typically represents a collection of related objects or items within a system, while an \u0022Aggregate Configuration\u0022 pertains to the configuration settings for these aggregates. The \u0022Operations\u0022 node is connected to a child node labeled \u0022Aggregate Operations,\u0022 which implies that each aggregate can have associated operations. These operations are likely to be the actions that can be performed on an aggregate within the system. Below the \u0022Aggregate Configurations\u0022 node, there\u0027s another child node titled \u0022Aggregate Functions.\u0022 This suggests that aggregates can have functions associated with them, which may represent the capabilities or features of the aggregates. The \u0022Configurations\u0022 node is connected to a subnode labeled \u0022Aggregate Functions,\u0022 which mirrors the concept from the \u0022Aggregate Operations\u0022 node. The presence of both operations and functions in separate nodes could imply that they are distinct entities, with functions being more specific than operations."

This ensures that the system can handle failures and maintain service availability. Additionally, there are two nodes representing different types of configurations: \u0022Aggregate Configurations\u0022 and \u0022Configuration Data.\u0022 The configuration data likely pertains to specific details or settings within the aggregate configuration.

There are also horizontal bars with various colors, which could be indicators of different performance metrics or statuses. Each bar has a number (from 1 to 5) at the top, possibly indicating the severity level of an issue or event detected by the system. Additional lines and markings, such as \u0022Interpolated Bounding Values\u0022 and \u0022OPC,\u0022 suggest that this chart is used for analyzing and visualizing data collected from a process control system with OPC UA capabilities. The specific details of what each symbol or line represents would require further context within the software interface where this image was taken."

This particular chart is titled \u0022StandardDeviationSample\u0022 and seems to relate to \u0022OPC UA,\u0022 which stands for OPC Unified Architecture, a standard for industrial automation and interoperability. The chart features a graph with one line that represents the standard deviation of a dataset over time. The x-axis (horizontal) is labeled \u0022x\u0022 but does not have specific numerical values, suggesting that it represents some form of continuous variable like time or another independent variable. The y-axis (vertical) is labeled \u0022\u03C3,\u0022 which stands for the Greek letter sigma and commonly denotes the standard deviation in statistics. On the graph, there\u0027s a vertical dashed line with a label \u0022\u03C3_avg\u0022 at the x-coordinate of 1, indicating the average value of the dataset over time. The line itself shows fluctuations that correspond to the standard deviation of the data points at each time or index point on the x-axis. Below the graph, there\u0027s a formula written in mathematical notation: \u03C3_avg = \u221A(\u2211[(x_i - x_avg)^2 / n) This equation represents the calculation for the sample average of the data points (\u03C3_avg), where \u0022x_i\u0022 represents each individual data point, \u0022x_avg\u0022 is the average value, and \u0022n\u0022 is the number of data points.

It appears to be a screenshot from a software application, possibly a spreadsheet or an equation editor. The expression includes several symbols and numbers:- \u03C3\u00B2_pop (the squared population standard deviation)- \u2211 (summation symbol, indicating the sum of all values in a series)- (x - x\u0304)\u00B2 (the variance term, which represents the square of the difference between each individual value (x) and the sample mean (x\u0304))- \u03BD (n\u00FAmero de dados ou n), representing the total number of observations or data points in the dataset In addition to the mathematical expression, there is a visual representation of a histogram at the bottom right corner of the image. This histogram shows the distribution of data points, with bars indicating the frequency of each value within the dataset. The histogram has a grid on the y-axis representing frequency and a bar for each observed value on the x-axis. On the right side of the histogram, there\u0027s a small text \u0022OPC and OPC UA,\u0022 which could refer to specific standards or protocols related to industrial interoperability that are relevant in this context. However, without additional information, it is not clear what these acronyms stand for. The background of the image has a gradient from dark to light grey, providing a neutral backdrop for the mathematical expression and histogram. The style of the document suggests it might be part of an academic paper or textbook related to statistics or data analysis, specifically focusing on standard deviation calculations in population data."
