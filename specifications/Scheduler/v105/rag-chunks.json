Those schedules can optionally also be manipulated via the information model.\nThe schedule defines on which dates they are active, and can also reference global calendars representing specific dates, for example public holidays. In addition, the schedule defines times and actions that should be executed at that time. The model defines writing Variables and calling Methods, but can be extended to other actions as well."

They are used to build a browse path between two Nodes or to define a standard Property.\nServers may often choose to use the same namespace for the NodeId and the BrowseName. However, if they want to provide a standard Property, its BrowseName shall have the namespace of the standards body although the namespace of the NodeId reflects something else, for example the EngineeringUnits Property.
